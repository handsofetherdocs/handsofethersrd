I, Aidan, put these together but it wouldn't have been possible without the greatest RPG ever made. If you like this game at all, go download the PDF from Palespine . Better yet, go buy it off of Amazon ! Enjoy the game! This manual is a tool used to forge stories. People live for stories - we build little ones in our minds, and nurture them into values and tenets. We share them between each other in the moments we feel most human and wild - on winter nights, or huddled away from the rain. When you play this game, you are taking part in the most ancient sort of ritual - a primordial, pure thing. It is important, despite the high and sometimes volatile emotions the stories may bring out in you, to follow three principles during the playing of this game. For this ritual to work, each of the storytellers around the table must \u2018be on the same page\u2019. Regardless of the other written rules strewn throughout this tome, these three principles are integral to having fun with this game - which is the true goal of it. Be Honest: This game and its story falters only when a player attempts to shape it into a competition. Lying about rolls, stealing the spotlight, or attempting to be coy or cunning as player instead of as a character will only bring shame and grief in the end. Be honest to yourself, the game, and your fellow players. Be Kind: This game works best when played with an open mind and an open heart. Respect each other, and don\u2019t be afraid to take a break if things get heated. Listen: Listen closely to what sort of intents and aims the other players are trying to bring into the story. Embrace and expand on other\u2019s ideas, and collaborate with them. How To Play # Hands of Ether is an imagination-fueled fantasy game filled with anomalous magic, savage battles, and harrowing quests. The game uses a combination of dice rolls, improvisational storytelling, and pen-and- paper rules to simulate a tale of sword and sorcery. The game has two types of players: the Guide, and the Adventurers. The Guide acts as the interpreter and judge of the game\u2019s rules. The Guide presents situations within the world that can be experienced and resolved by the Adventurers. The Guide is also responsible for determining the consequences of the Adventurer\u2019s actions. In addition to maintaining the game\u2019s rules, the Guide also acts as the driving force behind the game\u2019s setting and story. The Guide creates and narrates the atmosphere and details of the game\u2019s world, such as its culture, residents, and dangers. They tell the Adventurers what they are tasting, smelling, hearing, and feeling. Each player other than the Guide takes on the role of an Adventurer, which they design themselves. The Adventurers are the main characters of the story. Together, they form a party of Adventurers - a group of characters who work together to overcome challenges, go on quests, and tell their own story within the greater narrative. Each Adventurer is unique and individual. To create your own Adventurer\u2019s identity and determine their abilities, follow the instructions in the Character Creation section of this manual. Guides can use the rules throughout this manual to assist them in preparing their setting and story, but must also rely on their own skills of improvisation and imagination to flesh out the details of their fantasy landscape. Hands of Ether is best played in person, in an environment free of distractions. To play this game properly, you will need between 4-6 players, including a designated Guide. Each Player Needs: A Pencil. A Character Sheet. A set of dice. A quiet place with a table. This manual. Determination. Roleplaying game # If you are new to this game, or new to roleplaying games in general, the following chapter can assist you in understanding some of the core rules used throughout a typical adventure. As a player, however, you are not expected to understand or remember all of these rules perfectly. It is the Guide\u2019s responsibility to understand and enforce the rules of the game. Players are only expected to fulfill their Adventurer\u2019s role in the story, and to embody that Adventurer to the best of their ability. Roleplaying can be a difficult concept to understand for those who have never done such a thing before. To put it plainly, roleplaying is essentially \u2018playing pretend\u2019. You act and speak as a character you have created inside the fiction of the game\u2019s world. As an Adventurer, you control every element of your character. You can speak in their voice, saying what they say. You could also narrate your character\u2019s mannerisms and actions within the world, within reason. Fear not. No one at the table will be offended if your roleplay is lacking, and no one will judge you for your roleplaying in general. Play your character however you would like to. All players of this game should be approaching it with an intent to have fun with and respect the other participants around their table Rolling Dice # Dice are used as a tool to guide the story; to represent the elements of chance and danger throughout the game. Dice rolls are used in various situations, but the nature of each roll will vary. Most rolls will use a twenty-sided die, referred to as a d20. The most common type of dice roll in the game is when an Adventurer makes an ability check. If an Adventurer attempts an action that the Guide considers to have a degree of uncertainty or danger, the Guide can call for that Adventurer to make an ability check. Ability checks are made by rolling 1d20 and adding or subtracting an Adventurer\u2019s ability score modifier to the roll\u2019s total. A higher total is a better outcome for the Adventurer\u2019s attempted activity, and a lower total results in a worse outcome. If an Adventurer rolls a 20 on their die, they automatically succeed their check, regardless of their relative ability score modifier. If an Adventurer rolls a 1 on their die, they automatically fail. Each ability check made has a target number associated with it, known as a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC represents the difficulty of an endeavor, and is determined by the Guide. Difficult tasks will have a higher DC, and easier tasks will have a lower DC. If an Adventurer\u2019s check total meets or exceeds the DC of the check, they succeed in their attempted endeavor. If a check is made and does not meet or exceed the required DC, the Guide determines and narrates the consequences of failure. Exploration # Adventurers can explore the environment described by their Guide at will, within reason. The Adventurer\u2019s exploration of the environment is accomplished by announcing their actions to the Guide. They could declare to the Guide that they are smelling the air or feeling the walls. The Guide, in response, tells the Adventurers what they are experiencing and sensing as a result of their actions. This can help the Guide set the tone, and can help the Adventurers gain useful information about their situation. Exploring the environment may be integral for the Adventurer\u2019s to proceed forward, or could help the Adventurer\u2019s to better understand the story as a whole. In addition to their descriptions, the Guide may draw a map of the Adventurer\u2019s current location to act as a visual aid. The Guide is also free to call for ability checks on any exploration activities with a chance of failure, such as Agility checks for picking locks, Might checks for climbing walls, or Wit checks for discovering secret passages. Interacting with Others # Throughout an adventure, the Adventurers will interact with different characters and creatures within the fantasy world. The role of these non-player characters (NPCs) are voiced, acted out, and embodied by the Guide. Whenever an Adventurer wishes to engage in conversation with an NPC, the players and the Guide will have a conversation with each other as if their characters were actually speaking to each other. If an Adventurer attempts to socially influence an NPC during conversation, that Adventurer must roll a Will check to determine how well they do so and in what manner the NPC reacts to their attempt. If an Adventurer attempts to sense an NPC\u2019s emotions, such as to determine whether or not the NPC is lying to them, the Adventurer must roll a Wit check to determine whether or not they can properly read the NPC\u2019s intent or tone. Combat # Hands of Ether\u2019s world is rife with conflict. Adventurers will often find themselves engaged in combat against their adversaries. During a round of combat, each Adventurer can perform 2 Actions and move an amount of feet equal to their Speed score. Actions are used to perform any activity other than moving, such as drawing a weapon, drinking a potion, or climbing a wall. Attacking an enemy is the most common Action Adventurers tend to perform during combat. Actions can be used by an Adventurer at any time during a round of combat after their turn has begun. Attacking is accomplished by making an attack roll. Attack rolls are made by rolling 1d20 in an attempt to meet or exceed a DC equal to the target\u2019s Defense score. There are no bonuses or penalties applied to an attack roll by default. If an attack roll meets or exceeds this DC, the attack successfully hits and damages the target. Beyond attacking enemies with a weapon, Adventurers may use magical spells or combat skills to attack enemies. Each spell and skill has their own unique effect, which will be detailed in their individual descriptions. The World # Hands of Ether takes place in an outlandish world of crystal-encrusted forests, turbulent spats between dark factions, and valiant battles against ancient, pale giants. There are towns and villages of greatly varying cultures scattered throughout the densely wooded world. It rains more often than the sun deems to shine. A thick and unending sea of fog weaves its way into every nook and hidden rift within the mountain hollows. Mysteries are more prevalent than people in this world. While magic is real, it is a rare and fickle force that is barely understood by even the greatest of deities and spirits. There are a sparse few creatures of gifted, chosen, studious, or laboriously disciplined aptitudes that can wield small slivers of magic to limited degrees. The tools of the world are sturdy and intricate, but still primitive. The technology is on the cusp of mechanical complexity. Items such as telescopes, clocks, and even simplistic firearms exist within the world, albeit as rarities. Technology beyond these limitations are thought of as unknowable alien relics, and exist only in ancient ruins tucked away in forgotten, underground chasms. Outside the walls of settlements, a tumultuous landscape of vast and chaotic wilderness reigns. Cavernous crystal corridors connect subterranean ruins to the dens of twisted dragons. Foreboding, muted towers dot the horizon, long forgotten and filled with lurching monsters and peculiar artifacts to be plundered. Creaking, bark-encrusted giants roam the woodlands, mindless and volatile, their branched hair hanging low with intoxicating fruits. Storms of fungal spores sweep over the plains in great waves of neon mist. Vile cults in pale cloaks conspire in city sewers, determined to rectify their dead god. But these dark dangers are rare for most. Evil may brew and lurk, but most folk\u2019s lives are quiet and easy. Farms need to be tended, mead must be drank, and tomes must be scoured while the afternoon storm brews and clatters outside. The roads are safe for wandering pilgrims on their way to their family spirit\u2019s far-off shrine, or for caravans of merchants to sell wayward Adventurers oddities from between fur- curtained windows. This world\u2019s existence is a quiet one. But sometimes, the pot boils over. This is a world of soft extremes, at the pinnacle of both colorful and dark. When darkness looms in this way, the common folk call for eccentric and noble Adventurers to do away with that evil. Ether # The world is fueled by, and made up of, Ether - the unseen, swirling, vibrant, polychromatic fabric of the spiritual world. Every stone, beast, titan, sword, wand, crystal, tree, building, robe, concept, ideal, face, planet, and blade of grass is made up of, or connected to, the Ether. The Ether is the tapestry of souls. All things have their own souls, and all things are, together, one soul. Some beings can wield the Ether within themselves, sending it out into the world as a tool or weapon - this is called magic. Some beings can stir and churn the Ether, mixing one thread with another to create a new thread - this is called alchemy. Some beings, such as deities and spirits, are made up of nothing other than Ether. Mortal beings have but a sliver of Ether within them, powering them and connecting them to other sources and forms of Ether. While asleep, mortal beings can sometimes peer into or even alter some of the Ether\u2019s threads - this is known as dreaming. Each thread of Ether is independent and individual, but is always part of the greater whole of the tapestry. This means that each being and nonbeing within Hands of Ether is their own kind of Ether - separate from the Ether as a whole, but still connected. Ether is not like our energy - it can be created or destroyed. Ether can wax or wane, shrivel or blossom. No Fate # In Hands of Ether, deities form and are powered by belief. There are hundreds of spirits waxing and waning with the Ether and the faith of mortals. Ether is the, frenetic, physical manifestation of divinity and emotion. Belief and determination are the strongest and purest forms of emotion. Therefore, these two forms of emotion can cause supernatural results as they move and alter the Ether. Belief births, shapes, and powers beings of Ether into existence from nothingness. Determination, however, is another tale. This is a world forged by heroes and their determination - those that would toil to mend their ancestor\u2019s mistakes, who would stand against pale giants who seek to slay the world, who would choose their own path, against all odds, and fight until their last breath for their virtues, their family, and most importantly, their choice. There is one deity who does not exist - or rather, who was killed. It\u2019s death was the most integral to shaping this world. The heroes of this world slew the god of fate long ago. With its death came the death of infinite threads of Ether it had fabricated in its dark workshop of forced machinations. With its death came choice, hope, freedom, discovery, wonder, curiosity, catastrophe, and anguish, all born into the Ether in a moment swifter than light itself. In this world, there is no fate. The Story # These are the laws of this world. Throughout this manual, you will find many other hints to this world\u2019s true nature. It is up to the players and their Guide to fill in the gaps of this world\u2019s properties as they play, and to explore their own story within its framework. It is suggested, and integral, that each individual playing a role in this game pays close attention to the exact wordings of spells, skills, items, and other such details in this manual in order to determine the exact effects and alterations each of these things have on the world and its story. Each time a spell or skill is used, the Ether, is altered to accommodate those events. The game\u2019s world is ever-changing and ever- adapting. Despite all of this, the players and their Guide\u2019s interpretation of this entire manual is open to discussion and alteration, by the very nature of its existence.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#hands-of-ether","text":"Welcome to the hands of ether docs!

Your Adventurer could be spurred into action through any number of events. Maybe they are seeking wealth, or notoriety. Maybe they are on a quest to oppose some great evil. Adventures typically involve traveling from place to place, delving into mysterious ruins, and surviving in wild and inhospitable places. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which Adventurers interact with and overcome challenges during their quests. Travelling and Exploring # Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope; traveling from place to place can be just as harrowing and dangerous as combat in Hands of Ether. An individual Adventurer\u2019s Speed is not taken into account while traveling with a group of long distances, as a group of Adventurers will typically travel together at roughly the same pace. The Guide will sometimes choose to summarize an adventuring party\u2019s journey by narrating what happens between traveling from one destination to the next. They may describe the party traveling over an ancient stone bridge, fording a river, or laboriously ascending an icy mountain peak. Sometimes it is important, however, to know how long it takes to get from one place to another. Determining travel time depends solely on the agreed-upon travel pace of the adventuring group as well as the terrain they are traveling through. Traveling Adventurers can decide to move normally or quickly. Moving at a quickened pace lessens a party\u2019s travel time by half, but could spell disaster for the group as a whole. Adventurers that travel at a quickened pace for an hour of time must make a Might check against a DC of 10 or lose 2 Stamina each. Some terrain, called Rough terrain, can be tiresome and difficult for a creature to move through. Swamps, a room filled with rubble, or uneven ground can slow down an Adventurer\u2019s travel pace. While traveling long distances over Rough terrain, Adventurers must make a Might check against a DC of 10 or begin to lose Stamina at the Guide\u2019s discretion. Movement through dangerous dungeons or the wilderness often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go. Climbing, swimming, or moving underwater are considered movement through Rough terrain. In some instances, an Adventurer may be required to make a check when moving over certain kinds of terrain. Wading or swimming through a rushing river or climbing a steep vertical cliff, for instance, may require a successful Might check to overcome. Lastly, Adventurers who fail to eat or drink for a long period of time while on a journey may begin to lose Stamina at the Guide's discretion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can\u2019t be cured until the affected Adventurer eats and drinks. Working Together - Aiding # Outside of combat, Adventurers can attempt to assist each other with certain tasks. Adventurers can only team up to conquer a task together if the task being performed can be done as a group activity. For instance, an Adventurer could not help another Adventurer pick a lock. A group of Adventurers could, however, work together to clear away a pile of rubble. In such occurrences, Adventurers can attempt to aid each other\u2019s endeavors by making an Aid check. By default, Adventurers attempting to Aid each other do not add any modifiers to their 1d20 roll. The DC for Aid checks is always 10. On a success, an Adventurer attempting to Aid another Adventurer adds a +2 bonus to the final ability check result made by the Adventurer who is leading the effort. Falling, Traps, and Suffocation # There are a number of dangers involved in the exploration process. The most common of these are when an Adventurer suffers from a fall. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 damage for every 10 feet it falls past 20 feet. Falls from 20 feet or less are considered harmless. A creature who suffers damage from a fall lands Prone unless it reduces damage from the fall in some way, such as through the effects of a spell. Suffocation is the next most common threat to Adventurers. If a creature becomes covered in heavy rubble or finds themselves trapped underwater, they are at risk of suffocating. A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to its Might score modifier. If a creature is holding their breath during a combat encounter, however, that creature must make a successful Might check against a DC of 10 at the beginning of each of its turns as a Free Action. On a failure, the creature runs out of breath. If a creature runs out of breath, that creature loses all Health and becomes Unconscious and unstabilized. A suffocating creature can\u2019t regain Health until it can breath again, and must begin making Mortality checks on each turn after it has fallen Unconscious from suffocation. Lastly, some areas explored by Adventurers may harbor traps. Traps can always be avoided with the proper caution and care, but unaware Adventurers could find an early demise as a result of triggering the release of toxic gas or falling into a spike pit. Obscured Areas and Stealth # The most fundamental tasks of adventuring is perceiving danger, finding hidden items, and attacking enemies during combat. All of these tasks rely heavily on an Adventurer\u2019s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision, such as dense fog, can prove to be a significant hindrance to even the most skilled Adventurer. Any given area may be visually obscured due to a number of varying factors, such as darkness or dense fog. Any creature within an obscured area is considered Blinded and Covered. Obscured areas can sometimes be advantageous to Adventurers. Sneaking and hiding is a viable strategy for most Adventurers, as combat is always a gamble of life or death. While sneaking, Adventurers cannot hide in plain sight. There must be some form of cover, such as an obscured area, darkness, furniture, or trees in order for a creature to hide or sneak. Agility checks are used to sneak, hide, and move stealthily, and Wit checks are used to notice hidden or sneaking creatures. Interacting with Objects # Interacting with the environment is the most common activity Adventurers partake in, and can be done freely outside of combat encounters. The Adventurer expresses to the Guide how they would like to interact with the environment, and the Guide relays what, if anything, occurs as a result of that Adventurer\u2019s actions. For example, an Adventurer might decide to pull a lever, which may result in the raising of a portcullis or to cause a room to flood with water. If the lever is rusted in position, however, an Adventurer might need to make a successful Might check in order to wrench the lever into place. Adventurers can also damage items with their weapons and spells. The Guide determines an item\u2019s Defense and Health, and whether it can be hurt. Objects always fail Might and Agility checks, and they are immune to effects that require other checks. When an item reaches 0 Health, it becomes Broken. An Adventurer could also attempt a Might check to break an item. The Guide determines the DC for such a check. Bulk # Each item, creature, and structure has an amount of Bulk. Bulk is used to describe how much space an item takes up, how cumbersome it is to hold or carry, and how heavy an it is. For instance, a staff is 1 Bulk not because it is heavy, but because it is longer than the creature wielding it, and therefore somewhat cumbersome. Orbs are 1 Bulk because they are dense and heavy, despite being small in size. Some items, such as potions, have no Bulk at all. Items that are considered both lightweight and that can be held in the palm of the hand are bulkless. Bulkless items can be carried without burdening an Adventurer in any capacity. An Adventurer can carry an amount of Bulk equal to their Might. If an Adventurer begins carrying an amount of Bulk that exceeds their Bulk limit, they become Encumbered. Rest # After a long day of exploration and courageous endeavors, most Adventurers will want to bed down and recover. Taking a Rest requires 6 hours of uninterrupted downtime. A typical Rest is spent tending to chipped armor, patching wounds, catching up with comrades, and ultimately sleeping for the night. Upon taking a proper Rest, a creature naturally regains their maximum Health, Mana, Mortality, and Stamina. Adventurers will not naturally recover from Wounds, Corruptions, or curses during a Rest, and must be cured of these afflictions in some other way. Resting in harsh conditions, such as in a blizzard without tents and a fire, may do more harm than good. An Adventurer attempting to Rest in uncomfortable conditions must make a Might check against a DC of 10. On a failure, that Adventurer will not regain any Stamina or Mortality, but they do regain their Health and Mana as usual. Coin and Downtime # In Hands of Ether, there is one form of currency - Coin. Coin could look or act like however you\u2019d like in your own game\u2019s world. Coin could be bullets, tickets, doubloons, chunks of crystal or even actual coins. Adventurers can use their Coin to purchase usable items and other rewards within the world. Your Guide will have a list of items your party can buy for varying amounts of Coin. Coin is hard to come by, so shop wisely. Coin is most often used during downtime. Your Adventurer doesn\u2019t go delving into dungeons each and every day. Every Adventurer needs a break; a time to ease the stress of dungeon diving and dangerous combat. Outside of battling evil and exploring forgotten tombs, Adventurers are still people, and people need Rest and recuperation. Between adventures, you may have the opportunity to take part in some downtime. You can do whatever you wish during this time of refreshment. Give your Adventurer a hot bath and a big meal. Beyond spending Coin, Adventurers can spend their downtime doing any activities they wish. Maybe your Bard spends his time building his own hand-made lute, or your Cleric wishes to study and pray in the local monastery. It is important to spend time discussing what each Adventurer decides to do during their respective respite from the adventure.","title":"Adventuring"},{"location":"adventuring/#adventuring","text":"Now that you have created an Adventurer, it\u2019s time to take that Adventurer on a quest. Your Adventurer could be spurred into action through any number of events. Maybe they are seeking wealth, or notoriety. Maybe they are on a quest to oppose some great evil. Adventures typically involve traveling from place to place, delving into mysterious ruins, and surviving in wild and inhospitable places. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which Adventurers interact with and overcome challenges during their quests.","title":"Adventuring"},{"location":"adventuring/#travelling-and-exploring","text":"Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope; traveling from place to place can be just as harrowing and dangerous as combat in Hands of Ether. An individual Adventurer\u2019s Speed is not taken into account while traveling with a group of long distances, as a group of Adventurers will typically travel together at roughly the same pace. The Guide will sometimes choose to summarize an adventuring party\u2019s journey by narrating what happens between traveling from one destination to the next. They may describe the party traveling over an ancient stone bridge, fording a river, or laboriously ascending an icy mountain peak. Sometimes it is important, however, to know how long it takes to get from one place to another. Determining travel time depends solely on the agreed-upon travel pace of the adventuring group as well as the terrain they are traveling through. Traveling Adventurers can decide to move normally or quickly. Moving at a quickened pace lessens a party\u2019s travel time by half, but could spell disaster for the group as a whole. Adventurers that travel at a quickened pace for an hour of time must make a Might check against a DC of 10 or lose 2 Stamina each. Some terrain, called Rough terrain, can be tiresome and difficult for a creature to move through. Swamps, a room filled with rubble, or uneven ground can slow down an Adventurer\u2019s travel pace. While traveling long distances over Rough terrain, Adventurers must make a Might check against a DC of 10 or begin to lose Stamina at the Guide\u2019s discretion. Movement through dangerous dungeons or the wilderness often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go. Climbing, swimming, or moving underwater are considered movement through Rough terrain. In some instances, an Adventurer may be required to make a check when moving over certain kinds of terrain. Wading or swimming through a rushing river or climbing a steep vertical cliff, for instance, may require a successful Might check to overcome. Lastly, Adventurers who fail to eat or drink for a long period of time while on a journey may begin to lose Stamina at the Guide's discretion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can\u2019t be cured until the affected Adventurer eats and drinks.","title":"Travelling and Exploring"},{"location":"adventuring/#working-together-aiding","text":"Outside of combat, Adventurers can attempt to assist each other with certain tasks.

Of the many threats that Adventurers face, the catastrophes listed in the following tables are the most extreme. Sometimes luck is in favor of the Adventurer, and the result of a catastrophic event could be exactly what they need at a pivotal moment. Most of the time, however, catastrophes should be avoided at all costs. Catastrophes always occur as a Reaction, and it is suggested that the result of most catastrophes be rolled or determined by the Guide. Catastrophic Events come in four forms. Arcane Anomalies are the most common form of catastrophe. Magic is a chaotic force that can often spiral out of control. It is a force that even casters themselves hardly understand. Magic thinks, feels, and can and will often betray those that attempt to wield it, no matter their prowess. Corruption is when a creature is cursed, tormented, or driven insane either of their own accord or by the hand of another being. Avoiding Corruption is detrimental to an Adventurer's mental and emotional wellbeing. A number of unholy or deeply evil things could cause Corruption to afflict an Adventurer, with the most common cause of Corruption being the stress of adventuring itself. Mechanical Mishaps occur when some form of technology goes malfunctions. An alchemist could splash acid into his eyes by accident or a smith could scald himself on a freshly heated blade. These effects, although harmful, are easily and quickly cured. Lastly, the most detrimental catastrophe that an Adventurer could face is a Wound. Sometimes Adventurers will sustain an injury that is so brutal and gruesome that they are unable to heal them from Rest or natural recovery. These lingering injuries can still be healed by certain spells and abilities, but for the most part should be avoided at all costs. Arcane Anomalies # d20 Arcane Anomaly 1 Cataclysm. Something unfortunate and atrocious happens. The exact details of this event are determined by the Guide. 2 Magical Malfunction. Your magic is sporadic and out of your control. Roll on this table three additional times, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls. In addition, your Mana becomes completely depleted. 3 Backfire. Your magic combusts and causes you harm. Make an Agility check against a DC of 10. On a failure, you become Wounded. All other creatures within 10 feet of you take 1d10 damage. 4 Flash. A bright flash of arcane energy combusts in your face. You become Stunned until the end of the next round. All other creatures within 10 feet of you become Blinded until the beginning of the target's next turn. 5 Glitch. A magical error damages the integrity of your mind. You cast a Witch spell of the Guide\u2019s choice, and you become Corrupted. 6 Duplicate. A perfect simulacrum of yourself appears within 50 feet of you, resting on the ground and devoid of consciousness. 7 Uncontrolled Blasts. You expel multiple bursts of arcane energy. Each creature within 50 feet of you must succeed an Agility check against a DC of 10 or take 2d6 damage. 8 Wings. You cast the Fly spell on yourself for 0 Mana. 9 Phoenix. If you die within the next minute, a mysterious magic jolts you back to life and consciousness. You regain your maximum Health and maximum Mortality. 10 Speed.

The Guide determines the details of this event. 14 Spontaneous Ward. A spectral shell appears around you. You become Covered for 1 minute. 15 Arcane Boon. Your magic weaves itself into your body and enhances your abilities. You roll with advantage on all ability checks you make for 1 minute. 16 Formidable Empowerment. Your attacks become focused and powerful for a moment. Your next successful attack roll becomes a critical hit. 17 Guide\u2019s Gamble. You cast a single spell for 0 Mana. The Guide determines which spell you cast in this manner. 18 Shift. You teleport to a random place, determined by the Guide, within 100 feet of your original position. 19 Pyrobeatus. Choose a creature within range. That target takes 3d6 damage as they are blasted by a concentrated bolt of magical black flame. 20 Deliverance. Threads of Ether burst forth and weave through the air in a dazzling display. The vibrant, electric threads collide with yourself and all allies who you can see. You and all allies within visual range gain the benefits of a Rest. Corruptions # d20 Corruption 1 Insane. You become completely insane. You become a lethargic, gibbering shadow of your former self. You fall under the effects of the Enfeeble spell. 2 Broken Spirit. Your willpower is hanging on by a thread. You do not regain Mortality on Rests, and you are plagued by nightmares. 3 Cursed. Dark magic has weaved its way into your body, latching onto your soul like a parasite. Whenever you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll or ability check, an Arcane Anomaly occurs. 4 Unseen Things. You begin to suffer from extreme paranoia, complete with hallucinations and vivid nightmares of some dark, unseen force. You have disadvantage on all Will checks. 5 Frayed Thread.

The spirit\u2019s taunting is heard by you, but not by your companions. The spirit can compel you to perform an action of its choice once per Rest. If it attempts to do so, you must succeed a Will check against a DC of 15 or perform the action. Upon dispelling or curing this corruption, the spirit physically manifests in the space directly in front of the formerly possessed creature, and the formerly possessed creature becomes Unconscious and is considered Stabilized. The spirit has the statistics of any creature or monster that the Guide wishes. 9 Murderous. You harbor a murderous intent towards any creature you do not consider an ally, going into a reckless frenzy whenever you see an enemy. If an enemy is seen by you, you must immediately attempt to kill that enemy. You have advantage on all attack rolls made, and all attack rolls against you have advantage. 10 Hysterical. You begin to suffer from bursts of crazed laughter as well as a number of tremors and tics. You make all Might checks at disadvantage. 11 Murky Mind. You have become easily distracted, and your mental focus has been lost. You feel as though a thick haze has fallen over your senses. You have disadvantage on all Wit checks. 12 Haunted. Nightmarish visions plague you while you are both awake and dreaming. 13 Soul Scar. A deep madness, like a lodged bullet, embeds itself into the cord which binds you to the Ether. Your threads are bleached and slack. You can no longer hear the voices of gods nor spirits. Your perception of the world around you become dull and uninspired. You lose 1 spell of the Guide\u2019s choice. 14 Tongueless. You become unable to speak. 15 Broken Compass. Your will is broken, and you lose sight of the veil between dark and light. Unless it is obviously self-destructive, you will follow any commands other creatures issue to you. 16 Revulsion. You become overwhelmingly sickened by the company of others. While within 50 feet of another humanoid creature, you become Sapped. 17 The Shakes. Trembling at all times, you make attack rolls with disadvantage. 18 Compulsion. You fall under the effects of the Greed spell. The Guide decides what item you become obsessed with. 19 Babbler. You are constantly speaking in a strange, unknown language at a monotone volume. 20 Stalwart. Your will is unbroken. You become Sapped until your next Rest, but you do not gain a Corruption or become Corrupted. Mechanical Mishaps # d12 Corruption 1 Unfortunate Circumstance of Tremendous Proportions. A terrible accident occurs, the details of which are described by the Guide. You become Wounded. 2 Lethargy. A chemical reaction causes you to become suddenly lethargic. Your Stamina becomes 0 and you become Exhausted. 3 The Quicksilver Mistake. You ingest a toxic chemical and become Corrupted until your next Rest. 4 Drain. Something drains your physical energy. You lose 1d6 Stamina and 1d6 Health. 5 Inflamed. Something causes you to become especially susceptible to pain. Until your next Rest, you take an additional 1d4 damage whenever you take damage. 6 My Eyes! If you are not wearing protective gear to cover your eyes, you become Blinded. This condition lasts until your next Rest unless otherwise cured. 7 Not Contagious. Something causes you to develop a rash until your next Rest. Due to your constant scratching, you roll initiative checks with disadvantage until your next Rest. 8 Befuddling Gas. A strange gas emanates and is accidentally inhaled. You make Wit checks with disadvantage until your next Rest. 9 Red Eye. An explosive reaction flashes in your face, causing you to become Blinded until your next Rest but mysteriously invigorating you. You gain 3 temporary Stamina. These 3 temporary Stamina points cannot be regained, but can be added above the threshold of your default maximum Stamina. 10 Rust. A cloud of gas explodes outward and immediately rusts any nonmagical metallic items in the room, including the ones worn by you. Any nonmagical and metallic armor, weaponry, or items within 10 feet of you become Broken. 11 Boom. Something causes a reactionary combustion. You take 2d6 damage. 12 Happy Accident. You are jolted with electricity and regain 1d4 Stamina. If this Mechanical Mishap occurs while crafting an item, you also craft and gain twice the amount of items that you would normally craft by default. Wound Table # d12 Corruption 1 Vicissitude. It strikes straight through your heart. You are reduced to 0 Health, become Unconscious, and lose 1 Mortality. 2 Severed. Your hand has been severed from your body. You only have use of one hand, and cannot use or wield any items or weapons that require two hands. 3 Infection. A smaller injury of yours begins to seep with filth. A crown of yellowed sweat adorns your forehead. You become Sapped, your maximum Mortality is reduced by 1, and gain a persistent, hollow cough. 4 Numb. Your nerves have been damaged, and you become unable to feel pain. While you suffer from this Wound, the Guide does not disclose how much damage you take, but instead keeps track of the your Health in secret. The Guide only informs an Adventurer afflicted with this Wound whenever they fall Unconscious or regain consciousness. 5 Lethargic. Some part of you has given up. You cannot regain Stamina. 6 Gored. A massive injury in your abdomen causes you to become all but defenseless to further attacks. Weary and constantly bent over in pain, you lose 1 additional Stamina whenever you lose Stamina or spend Stamina. 7 Bleeding. Lacerations cover your body, too deep and abundant to be healed through normal means. You take 1d4 damage at the beginning of each round of combat. Outside of combat, you take 1d4 damage once every hour, unless you are Resting. Other creatures roll Wit checks with advantage when attempting to track a Bleeding creature due to the trail of blood they leave behind. 8 Gouged. Your eyes have been gouged out, gashed, or otherwise damaged beyond repair. You become Blinded. 9 Concussion. A heavy blow to the head has made you despondent and hazy. You roll with disadvantage on all Wit checks. 10 Limp. You have taken on a debilitating limp. You become Encumbered. 11 Charred. Your skin broils, and you are burned. You gain a permanent burn scar. Whenever you take damage, you take an additional 1d4 damage. 12 Grazed. You are able to narrowly escape what might have been a serious wound. You instead take 1d4 additional damage, and you do not gain a Wound or become Wounded.","title":"Catastrophes"},{"location":"catastrophes/#catastrophes","text":"The world of Hands of Ether is a chaotic and dangerous one.

This character is used as a tool by the player to experience the world and story - a portal and proxy to the adventure. An Adventurer\u2019s capabilities and identity is determined by their player\u2019s choice of class, lineage, skills, spells, and ability scores. Each player determines the aspects of their Adventurer, such as their name, appearance, species, personality, and history. Each Adventurer also has a class, which is a set of talents and techniques they use as a tool to overcome challenges during the adventure. Each class has a primary ability and its own unique list of skills and spells to choose from. Beyond your Adventurer\u2019s scores and abilities, it is just as important to breath life into your Adventurer as a person. Think about what sort of goals, intents, or tenets your Adventurer may have. Consider their early life - was it lived out under tenuous tutelage in a dim monastery, or filled with sunshiny afternoons on the family farm? Try to imagine what your Adventurer\u2019s ambitions and desires might be. These kind of questions can guide you in choosing the right skills for your Adventurer, but can also help you to better embody them while roleplaying. Try creating an Adventurer with other players in mind, and to make an Adventurer that will benefit the story as a whole.

Creating a Level One Adventurer Quick Reference # Identity Choose your Adventurer\u2019s name, appearance, class, and lineage. Ability Scores Determine your Adventurer\u2019s ability scores. The default method used to determine your Adventurer\u2019s ability scores is to roll 3d6 four separate times. Apply each of the four rolled totals to an ability score of your choice. Then, add your lineage ability score improvements to the corresponding ability scores. Lastly, calculate and apply each of your ability score modifiers using the chart below. Other methods of determining your ability scores can be found later in this chapter. Minor Scores Determine your Adventurer\u2019s minor scores; Bulk Limit, Defense, Health, Mana, Speed, Spell DC, and Stamina using the following Score Quick Reference. Your Adventurer\u2019s size is determined by their lineage. Skills Apply your lineage skills. Then, choose and apply 1 starting skill from either your class skill list or the general skill list. Experience Choose your starting equipment, languages, and proficiencies. Spells If your Adventurer is a caster class, choose 2 spells and 2 cantrips to begin with from your class spell list. Default Scores at Level One # Score Value Bulk Limit Equal to your Adventurer\u2019s Might score. Defense Equal to your Adventurer\u2019s Agility score. Health Determined by your Adventurer\u2019s lineage. Speed Determined by your Adventurer\u2019s lineage. Stamina Equal to the your Adventurer\u2019s Might score. Languages 2 Proficiencies 3 Skills Equal to your Adventurer\u2019s level + lineage skills. Default Caster Scores at Level One # Score Value Mana Equal to your Adventurer\u2019s level multiplied by 2. Spell DC Equal to your Adventurer\u2019s primary ability score, determined by their class. Spells Known Equal to your Adventurer\u2019s level multiplied by 2. Cantrips Known 2 Class and Lineage # Your Adventurer\u2019s identity is based largely around their class and lineage. An Adventurer\u2019s class defines what kind of techniques and talents they use to overcome challenges during their adventure. An Adventurer\u2019s class could be that of a Warrior, who battles their enemies brazenly with sword and shield, or a Sage, who takes a more cautious, intellectual approach when overcoming adversity. An Adventurer\u2019s lineage is their ancestry, or species, that they were born into. Besides dictating an Adventurer\u2019s appearance to an extent, lineage also grants an Adventurer with a few skills that represent their species\u2019 natural talents. Dwarves, for instance, can see in the dark as a natural result of their underground heritage. Each lineage also improves an Adventurer\u2019s ability scores to differing degrees. Ogres, for instance, are naturally more brawny than other species. These ability score improvements listed under each lineage increase an Adventurer\u2019s ability scores, not their ability score modifiers. Ability Scores # Each creature, including each Adventurer, has four ability scores that are used to define and describe their strengths and weaknesses in the game world. These ability scores are Agility, Might, Will, and Wit. To determine an Adventurer\u2019s ability scores at level 1, roll 3d6 for each score and apply each separately rolled total to an ability score of your choice. Alternatively, you could use and apply the standard, predetermined scores of 14, 11, 10, and 7. If you use this standard array of scores, you can place them in whichever ability scores you so choose. If you wish to roll with less chance of low scores, you and your adventuring group could instead agree to roll 4d6 for each ability score total, discarding the lowest die from each roll of 4d6. This option is best if your players and your Guide are beginning a long-term campaign. If none of these methods suit your game\u2019s needs, it is recommended that the player and their Guide discuss what the Adventurer\u2019s former life was like, and what sorts of events shaped their past to determine your Adventurer\u2019s ability scores manually. Ability scores can never be lower than 3 or higher than 18, unless magic is afoot. After rolling your ability scores, be sure to apply your lineage\u2019s ability score improvements. Agility is the attribute used to gauge a creature's dexterity, as well as how quickly and effectively they can react to their surroundings. A high score in Agility may mean the creature has quick reflexes or that their hand-eye coordination is especially well-trained. Agility is used to evade physical effects and attacks, carefully manipulate items, sneak, balance, and perform feats of dexterity. Might represents a creature's constitution, strength, and physicality. A creature with a high Might could be brawny and tough, or they may have an especially high threshold of endurance against injuries or toxins. Might is used in battle to resist physical effects and to perform feats of strength. Will is a creature's mental and emotional resolve, their charisma, and their ability to wield or resist magical forces. Creatures with a high Will score may be especially courageous, devoted, charming, or magical. Will is used to navigate social interactions, to resist mind-altering effects, and to channel magic. Wit is a creature's general cognition, their knowledge of the world around them, and how well they utilize that knowledge. Adventurers with high Wit could be wise scholars, perceptive scouts, or cunning criminals. Wit is used to understand and apply knowledge, recall lore, perceive and understand your surroundings, and to investigate. Each of these four ability scores have a smaller number associated with them called a modifier. Modifiers are always used in conjunction with a relative ability check. They are applied to the total result of an ability check as either a bonus or a penalty. Score Modifier 3 -3 4-5 -2 6-8 -1 9-12 +0 13-15 +1 16-17 +2 18 +3 Whenever your Adventurer reaches level 5, you can increase a single ability score of your choice by 3 points, or increase a number of ability scores by 3 separate points. An ability score\u2019s modifier may increase as a result of this enhancement. Minor Scores # Beyond their four ability scores, each Adventurer also has a number of minor scores that represent their current condition. These minor scores are called Health, Stamina, Defense, Speed, Bulk Limit, Mortality, Mana, and Spell DC. Health. Health is how much physical vitality a creature has remaining before they can no longer remain conscious. If a creature reaches 0 Health, they become Unconscious and unstabilized. An Adventurer\u2019s maximum Health is determined by their lineage. Stamina. Stamina is an Adventurer's endurance and physical energy. Strenuous activities may result in an Adventurer's Stamina being depleted. Some class abilities and skills require the spending of Stamina to use or activate. If an Adventurer's Stamina is reduced to 0, they become Exhausted. An Adventurer's maximum Stamina is equal to their Might score. Defense. The score that represents how difficult it is to successfully damage a creature. A high Defense could mean a creature\u2019s armor is sturdy and difficult to pierce, or that they are proficient at dodging attacks. Each creature and item in the game has a Defense. Attack rolls must meet or exceed a target\u2019s Defense in order to deal any damage to that target. By default, an Adventurer's Defense is equal to their Agility score. Speed. This score is how quickly a creature can move during their turn. An Adventurer's Speed is determined by their lineage, and defined by increments of 5 feet. Bulk Max. This score represents how much an Adventurer can carry. If an Adventurer is carrying an amount of Bulk that exceeds their Bulk score, they become Encumbered. Mortality. Mortality represents an Adventurer\u2019s ability to cling to life while Unconscious. Each Adventurer has a maximum of 3 Mortality by default. Adventurers regain their maximum amount of Mortality each Rest. If an Adventurer reaches 0 Mortality, that Adventurer dies. Mana. Mana represents the Ether within an Adventurer, and their capability to use that Ether. Mana is essentially a reflection of the amount of magical energy and potential an Adventurer possesses. Most spells require the spending of this magical energy in order to be cast. Some Adventurers do not have any Mana. If an Adventurer does have Mana, that Adventurer's maximum Mana is equal to their level multiplied by 2. Spell DC. The DC for resisting or avoiding magical effects which a creature casts. An Adventurer\u2019s spell DC is equal to their class\u2019s primary ability score. Skills # Each Adventurer has a number of skills that they can use while adventuring. Each class has a list of skills to choose from. Skills are abilities, talents, or techniques that are used to perform specific activities or abilities. An Adventurer\u2019s true talents and capabilities are determined by which skills they possess. When gaining a skill, an Adventurer can choose a skill from either the general skill list or from their class skill list. Each Adventurer begins at level 1 with 1 skill by default, as well as their lineage skills. Adventurers gain 1 new skill each time they advance in level. Once an Adventurer has gained a certain skill, they can never gain that same skill again. Spells # If your Adventurer is a casting class, they know an amount of spells. By default, the amount of spells an Adventurer knows is equal to their level multiplied by 2. Each casting Adventurer also begins at level 1 with 1 cantrip of their choice. Cantrips are simple spells that require no Mana to cast. Each caster gains 1 additional cantrip of their choice from their class cantrip list whenever they reach level 3, level 6, and level 9. Each caster also has a spell DC, which is a minor score used to determine whether or not a target of a spell can resist or evade that spell\u2019s effects. A caster\u2019s spell DC is equal to their primary ability score. Proficiencies # Each Adventurer begins with 3 proficiencies of their choice. Proficiencies represent training with certain types of protective gear, weapons, or items. There are six distinct types of proficiencies that an Adventurer could possess. Adventurers that attempt to use an item they lack proficiency in become susceptible to that type of item\u2019s untrained penalty; the details of which are listed below each proficiency in the following list. Armor. Platemail, leather, padded suits, breastplates; any and all types of worn protective garb. Untrained Penalty: While armor is being worn by an Adventurer that does not have proficiency in armor, that Adventurer becomes Encumbered. Melee. Swords, hammers, axes, daggers, and any other type of weapon with a 5 foot melee range. Untrained Penalty: Adventurers lacking proficiency with melee weapons make attack rolls with them at disadvantage. Artifact. The use of magic devices, such as rods, orbs, and other arcane implements. This includes thrown potions and bombs. Untrained Penalty: Adventurers not proficient in the use of magic devices must roll 1d4 whenever they use an Action to activate or trigger such items. On a result of 1, an Arcane Anomaly occurs. Reach. Long-reaching melee weaponry, such as glaives, whips, and spears, that have a 10 foot melee range. Untrained Penalty: Adventurers lacking proficiency with reach weapons make attack rolls with them at disadvantage. Ranged. Bows, firearms, slings, thrown daggers, and other ranged weaponry that relies on accuracy over power. Untrained Penalty: Adventurers lacking proficiency with ranged weapons make attack rolls with them at disadvantage. A roll result of 1 made with a ranged weapon by an Adventurer who lacks proficiency in ranged weapons results in that Adventurer automatically hitting their closest ally. Shield. Shields used to block attacks and further protect the wielder beyond the use of armor. Untrained Penalty: Adventurers lacking proficiency with shields only benefit from a +1 bonus to their Defense whenever they use that shield to defend themselves, no matter the Defense bonus of that particular shield. Languages # Each Adventurer starts at level 1 knowing 2 languages of their choice. There are a total of six different languages that exist in the world of Hands of Ether. Cipher. A codified language spoken by thieves, insurgents, and others that wish for their communication to remain veiled and secret. It is made up of nonsense words and secret phrases that obscure the true meaning of what is being spoken. Common. The most well-known and most commonly spoken tongue. All species and cultures speak this language, having been inundated with it from a young age. Deep. The language of the underground. Goblins and other dwellers of the caverns below the surface world speak this twisted tongue. Green. The wild tongue. Fairy creatures, beasts, and other beings of nature speak the silky words of this elegant and whimsical language between each other. High. High is a language designated for those of noble heritage or high ranks. The High language is uncommon, and mostly used to put on a show of power amongst rich merchants and bureaucrats. High speech is eloquent and luxurious, and is often used in songs and poems because of its beauty. Its origin does not lie in the house of nobles, however, but is actually the natural tongue of spirits and gods that was stolen and misused by mortals. Most mortal creatures, even those that speak the language, are unaware of its origins. Primordial. A dead language, and the rarest form of spoken communication. It is spoken by ancient creatures, and can sometimes be found inscribed onto old ruins or along the blades of legendary swords. Starting Equipment # Each Adventurer begins at level 1 having a number of items already in their possession. Each Adventurer begins with: 1 kit of their choice. 10 Coin. 1 set of clothing of their choice. 1 of each type of item which they are proficient in. An Adventurer who is proficient with shields and armor, for instance, begins with 1 shield and 1 set of armor in their possession. If the Adventurer is a caster, they also begin with a casting focus, such as a wand, staff, holy symbol, spell book, or other trinket that the caster uses to channel their magic through. If an Adventurer\u2019s starting items include a ranged weapon, that Adventurer also begins with 2d10 pieces of ammunition made for that ranged weapon. Lastly, Adventurers proficient in artifacts must speak with their Guide to determine what sort of magical item that Adventurer begins with. An orb infused with a single minor spell is a good choice if an artifact cannot be decided on through conversation between the player and the Guide. Leveling Up # Through adventuring, experiencing, and overcoming challenges, Adventurers will naturally become more powerful within their respective skill set. This process is called leveling up. While Adventurers begin at level 1, they may progress up to level 10, where they are considered renowned heroes. Each time an Adventurer levels up, they gain new skills and improved abilities. The Guide determines when the party levels up. The Guide typically advances the party in level whenever they overcome an event that is particularly challenging or harrowing. It is highly recommended that each member of an adventuring party levels up at the same time in order to maintain consistency in their story as a whole. Each time an Adventurer levels up, they gain the following enhancements. Health. The Adventurer\u2019s maximum Health increases. Roll that Adventurer\u2019s Health die, determined by their lineage\u2019s \u201cHealth Increase at Level Up\u201d statistic, and increase their maximum Health by an amount equal to the rolled result. Skills. The Adventurer gains 1 new skill of their choice from their class skill list or the general skill list. Magic. If the Adventurer is a caster, their maximum Mana increases by 2. In addition, they gain 2 new spells of their choice from their class spell list. They gain 1 new cantrip of their choice whenever they reach levels 3, 6, and 9. Ability Scores. Whenever the Adventurer reaches level 5, an ability score of their choice increases by 3, to a maximum of 18. Be sure to adjust other scores and ability score modifiers if those scores would be increased or affected as a result of this ability score improvement.","title":"Character Creation"},{"location":"charactercreation/#character-creation","text":"Each player in the game other than the Guide creates an Adventurer that they embody and control.

Alternatively, you could use and apply the standard, predetermined scores of 14, 11, 10, and 7. If you use this standard array of scores, you can place them in whichever ability scores you so choose. If you wish to roll with less chance of low scores, you and your adventuring group could instead agree to roll 4d6 for each ability score total, discarding the lowest die from each roll of 4d6. This option is best if your players and your Guide are beginning a long-term campaign. If none of these methods suit your game\u2019s needs, it is recommended that the player and their Guide discuss what the Adventurer\u2019s former life was like, and what sorts of events shaped their past to determine your Adventurer\u2019s ability scores manually. Ability scores can never be lower than 3 or higher than 18, unless magic is afoot. After rolling your ability scores, be sure to apply your lineage\u2019s ability score improvements. Agility is the attribute used to gauge a creature's dexterity, as well as how quickly and effectively they can react to their surroundings. A high score in Agility may mean the creature has quick reflexes or that their hand-eye coordination is especially well-trained. Agility is used to evade physical effects and attacks, carefully manipulate items, sneak, balance, and perform feats of dexterity. Might represents a creature's constitution, strength, and physicality. A creature with a high Might could be brawny and tough, or they may have an especially high threshold of endurance against injuries or toxins. Might is used in battle to resist physical effects and to perform feats of strength. Will is a creature's mental and emotional resolve, their charisma, and their ability to wield or resist magical forces. Creatures with a high Will score may be especially courageous, devoted, charming, or magical. Will is used to navigate social interactions, to resist mind-altering effects, and to channel magic. Wit is a creature's general cognition, their knowledge of the world around them, and how well they utilize that knowledge. Adventurers with high Wit could be wise scholars, perceptive scouts, or cunning criminals. Wit is used to understand and apply knowledge, recall lore, perceive and understand your surroundings, and to investigate. Each of these four ability scores have a smaller number associated with them called a modifier. Modifiers are always used in conjunction with a relative ability check. They are applied to the total result of an ability check as either a bonus or a penalty. Score Modifier 3 -3 4-5 -2 6-8 -1 9-12 +0 13-15 +1 16-17 +2 18 +3 Whenever your Adventurer reaches level 5, you can increase a single ability score of your choice by 3 points, or increase a number of ability scores by 3 separate points. An ability score\u2019s modifier may increase as a result of this enhancement.","title":"Ability Scores"},{"location":"charactercreation/#minor-scores","text":"Beyond their four ability scores, each Adventurer also has a number of minor scores that represent their current condition. These minor scores are called Health, Stamina, Defense, Speed, Bulk Limit, Mortality, Mana, and Spell DC. Health. Health is how much physical vitality a creature has remaining before they can no longer remain conscious. If a creature reaches 0 Health, they become Unconscious and unstabilized. An Adventurer\u2019s maximum Health is determined by their lineage. Stamina. Stamina is an Adventurer's endurance and physical energy. Strenuous activities may result in an Adventurer's Stamina being depleted. Some class abilities and skills require the spending of Stamina to use or activate. If an Adventurer's Stamina is reduced to 0, they become Exhausted. An Adventurer's maximum Stamina is equal to their Might score. Defense. The score that represents how difficult it is to successfully damage a creature. A high Defense could mean a creature\u2019s armor is sturdy and difficult to pierce, or that they are proficient at dodging attacks. Each creature and item in the game has a Defense. Attack rolls must meet or exceed a target\u2019s Defense in order to deal any damage to that target. By default, an Adventurer's Defense is equal to their Agility score. Speed. This score is how quickly a creature can move during their turn. An Adventurer's Speed is determined by their lineage, and defined by increments of 5 feet. Bulk Max. This score represents how much an Adventurer can carry. If an Adventurer is carrying an amount of Bulk that exceeds their Bulk score, they become Encumbered. Mortality. Mortality represents an Adventurer\u2019s ability to cling to life while Unconscious. Each Adventurer has a maximum of 3 Mortality by default. Adventurers regain their maximum amount of Mortality each Rest. If an Adventurer reaches 0 Mortality, that Adventurer dies. Mana. Mana represents the Ether within an Adventurer, and their capability to use that Ether. Mana is essentially a reflection of the amount of magical energy and potential an Adventurer possesses. Most spells require the spending of this magical energy in order to be cast. Some Adventurers do not have any Mana. If an Adventurer does have Mana, that Adventurer's maximum Mana is equal to their level multiplied by 2. Spell DC. The DC for resisting or avoiding magical effects which a creature casts.

When gaining a skill, an Adventurer can choose a skill from either the general skill list or from their class skill list.

Adventurers that attempt to use an item they lack proficiency in become susceptible to that type of item\u2019s untrained penalty; the details of which are listed below each proficiency in the following list. Armor. Platemail, leather, padded suits, breastplates; any and all types of worn protective garb. Untrained Penalty: While armor is being worn by an Adventurer that does not have proficiency in armor, that Adventurer becomes Encumbered. Melee. Swords, hammers, axes, daggers, and any other type of weapon with a 5 foot melee range. Untrained Penalty: Adventurers lacking proficiency with melee weapons make attack rolls with them at disadvantage. Artifact. The use of magic devices, such as rods, orbs, and other arcane implements. This includes thrown potions and bombs. Untrained Penalty: Adventurers not proficient in the use of magic devices must roll 1d4 whenever they use an Action to activate or trigger such items. On a result of 1, an Arcane Anomaly occurs. Reach. Long-reaching melee weaponry, such as glaives, whips, and spears, that have a 10 foot melee range. Untrained Penalty: Adventurers lacking proficiency with reach weapons make attack rolls with them at disadvantage. Ranged. Bows, firearms, slings, thrown daggers, and other ranged weaponry that relies on accuracy over power. Untrained Penalty: Adventurers lacking proficiency with ranged weapons make attack rolls with them at disadvantage. A roll result of 1 made with a ranged weapon by an Adventurer who lacks proficiency in ranged weapons results in that Adventurer automatically hitting their closest ally. Shield. Shields used to block attacks and further protect the wielder beyond the use of armor.

There are a total of six different languages that exist in the world of Hands of Ether. Cipher. A codified language spoken by thieves, insurgents, and others that wish for their communication to remain veiled and secret. It is made up of nonsense words and secret phrases that obscure the true meaning of what is being spoken. Common. The most well-known and most commonly spoken tongue. All species and cultures speak this language, having been inundated with it from a young age. Deep. The language of the underground. Goblins and other dwellers of the caverns below the surface world speak this twisted tongue. Green. The wild tongue. Fairy creatures, beasts, and other beings of nature speak the silky words of this elegant and whimsical language between each other. High. High is a language designated for those of noble heritage or high ranks. The High language is uncommon, and mostly used to put on a show of power amongst rich merchants and bureaucrats. High speech is eloquent and luxurious, and is often used in songs and poems because of its beauty. Its origin does not lie in the house of nobles, however, but is actually the natural tongue of spirits and gods that was stolen and misused by mortals. Most mortal creatures, even those that speak the language, are unaware of its origins. Primordial. A dead language, and the rarest form of spoken communication. It is spoken by ancient creatures, and can sometimes be found inscribed onto old ruins or along the blades of legendary swords.","title":"Languages"},{"location":"charactercreation/#starting-equipment","text":"Each Adventurer begins at level 1 having a number of items already in their possession.

If the Adventurer is a caster, they also begin with a casting focus, such as a wand, staff, holy symbol, spell book, or other trinket that the caster uses to channel their magic through. If an Adventurer\u2019s starting items include a ranged weapon, that Adventurer also begins with 2d10 pieces of ammunition made for that ranged weapon. Lastly, Adventurers proficient in artifacts must speak with their Guide to determine what sort of magical item that Adventurer begins with.

This process is called leveling up. While Adventurers begin at level 1, they may progress up to level 10, where they are considered renowned heroes. Each time an Adventurer levels up, they gain new skills and improved abilities. The Guide determines when the party levels up. The Guide typically advances the party in level whenever they overcome an event that is particularly challenging or harrowing. It is highly recommended that each member of an adventuring party levels up at the same time in order to maintain consistency in their story as a whole. Each time an Adventurer levels up, they gain the following enhancements. Health. The Adventurer\u2019s maximum Health increases. Roll that Adventurer\u2019s Health die, determined by their lineage\u2019s \u201cHealth Increase at Level Up\u201d statistic, and increase their maximum Health by an amount equal to the rolled result.

In addition, they gain 2 new spells of their choice from their class spell list. They gain 1 new cantrip of their choice whenever they reach levels 3, 6, and 9. Ability Scores. Whenever the Adventurer reaches level 5, an ability score of their choice increases by 3, to a maximum of 18. Be sure to adjust other scores and ability score modifiers if those scores would be increased or affected as a result of this ability score improvement.","title":"Leveling Up"},{"location":"combat/","text":"Combat # Combat encounters are violent conflicts between two or more opposing forces. No matter how powerful an Adventurer is, combat is always a gamble of life or death. Each Adventurer has a number of abilities and skills they can use during combat. The Guide controls enemies during combat in an effort to prove victorious against the Adventurers. Remember, Adventurers - your enemies want to win. Unless the adversary you are battling is a mindless monster, they will use any advantage at their disposal to ensure your demise. The key to surviving a combat encounter is understanding the rules of combat. Initiative # Hands of Ether organizes combat and other dangerous scenarios into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents the passing of ten seconds in the game world. During a round, each combatant in the battle takes a turn. Once all combatants have taken a turn, the fight continues on to the next round if neither side has defeated the other. The order of these turns is determined at the beginning of combat by rolling initiative. When combat begins, each creature involved in the battle rolls 1d20 and applies any bonuses they might have to determine their place in the initiative order. The Guide rolls initiative for any creatures or other forces in the battle that are not controlled by the players. If one group of combatants surprises their opposition, such as by ambushing them, each member of the surprising group are allowed to perform 1 Action of their choice before initiative is rolled. This is known as a surprise round. The Guide ranks the combatants in order from the highest initiative result to the the lowest. This is the order in which each participant begins their turn during each round. The initiative order remains the same on each subsequent round unless the initiative order is altered by a skill or spell effect. Then, each combatant takes their turn in initiative order. Once each combatant has taken their turn, the round ends. Repeat this process until all but one group of combatants has fled, been defeated, or proved victorious in combat. Initiative is not just used to measure the flow of battles - it can be initiated by the Guide during any event which forces the Adventurers to act under pressure. Escaping the rapids of a powerful river, trespassing in a noble\u2019s castle, or chasing down a thief are all gameplay moments best played out using the initiative system. Your Turn # At the beginning of a combatant\u2019s turn, they gain access to their Speed and their Actions. Any number of Actions that go unused after a combatant's turn ends are considered held Actions by default. Held Actions can be used at any time between the end of a combatant\u2019s turn and the end of the round. Once a round has ended, all held Actions disappear and become wasted. During a combatant\u2019s turn, they can use their Speed to move a number of feet equal to their Speed score. This use of Speed can be separated by Actions however they wish. For instance, the combatant could move half of their Speed towards an enemy, attack them using an Action, and then move back to their original position using the other half of their Speed. A combatant cannot move more feet than their maximum Speed during a turn in combat unless otherwise stated by a skill or spell effect. Unlike Actions, a combatant\u2019s Speed can only be used during their turn in combat. Any task a combatant wishes to perform that is not moving from one place to another or vocally communicating is considered an Action, not Speed. Climbing, going prone, vaulting over a small wall, opening a door, jumping, and similar activities are all considered Actions. The amount of Actions that a Guide-controlled combatant has access to in an encounter are determined by the Guide, while Adventurers have 2 Actions by default. If an Adventurer wishes to perform an activity in battle that is not listed in this manual's default rules, the Guide determines if the task is possible as well as how many Actions it will cost to perform this endeavor. The only tasks during combat that can be performed without using an Action are dropping items and speaking between other combatants. Dialogue never costs an Action, and players are encouraged to banter and roleplay amongst each other and their opponents during battle. Some tasks and abilities, such as casting certain spells, cost more than 1 Action to perform. There are also some skills and abilities that allow Adventurers to perform two activities using only 1 Action, such as the Warrior\u2019s Surge ability. Common Actions # There are a number of Actions that any creature or Adventurer can do that does not require any special abilities or skills. These tasks cost 1 Action to perform. If a task is not listed here, it is up to the Guide to determine how many Actions that task would cost to perform. Typically, performing any activity in the heat of battle costs a combatant 1 Action. The following is a list of activities that cost 1 Action to perform to serve as an example. Making an attack roll. Performing any activity that requires an ability check, such as making a Wit check to perceive your surroundings or a Might check to kick open a jammed door. Withdrawing or stowing an item or weapon. Raising a shield to defend oneself. Donning or doffing an adornment or piece of armor, such as a helmet or a ring. Falling prone, or standing up from the prone position. Consuming something, such as eating a bite of food or drinking a potion. Reloading a weapon that requires ammunition, such as a bow or a firearm. Attack Rolls # Whenever a combatant wishes to attack another creature, their attack roll determines whether their attack successfully deals any damage to their target. To make an attack roll, roll 1d20 against a DC of your target\u2019s Defense. By default, Adventurers do not add any bonuses to their attack rolls, and instead simply use the rolled result as the attack roll\u2019s total. If the total result of an attack roll equals or exceeds a target\u2019s Defense, the attack hits and deals damage to the target. If the total result of an attack roll does not meet a target\u2019s Defense, the target avoids the attack in some way and takes no damage. The Defense of an Adventurer is determined at character creation, whereas the Defense of an non-player target is determined by the Guide. There are a number of factors that could improve a creature\u2019s default Defense, such as wearing armor or casting a defensive spell. Damage # Injury and the risk of death are constant threats to Adventurers. Whenever a creature takes damage, that creature\u2019s Health is reduced by an amount equal to the damage dealt to it. The loss of Health has no effect on a creature\u2019s abilities until that creature is reduced to 0 Health. Each weapon, spell, and ability specifies the damage it deals, if any. The attacker always rolls the damage die to determine how much damage their target is dealt. Magical weapons, class abilities, and other factors could grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage to a target, but never negative damage. If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, the attacker only rolls the damage dice once to determine how much damage each target takes. If an Adventurer reduces a target to 0 Health using a melee weapon, that Adventurer can indicate that they wish to deal nonlethal damage to the target. If an Adventurer does this, the target becomes Unconscious and Stabilized instead of dying. It is possible for a creature to be killed instantly from an attack or circumstance which deals a massive amount of damage to them. If an Adventurer takes an amount of damage from one attack which equals or exceeds their maximum Health, they must make a Might check against a DC of 10 or die instantly. Critical Hits and Natural Ones # Even experienced Adventurers make mistakes, and even novice Adventurers can be favored by fate. If an attack roll results in a roll of 20 before any modifiers are applied, that attack roll hits regardless of any bonuses, penalties, or the target\u2019s Defense. This is called a critical hit. If the d20 roll result for an attack roll is a 1, the attack roll misses regardless of any modifiers or the target\u2019s Defense. Rolling a 1 on an attack roll has no other special rules, but critical hits have a number of effects depending on what kind of attack is being made. If a weapon makes a critical hit, the damage dice used for that weapon attack roll is doubled. If a weapon typically does 1d6 damage, for instance, a critical hit with that weapon would deal 2d6. If the attack's damage has any bonuses attributed to it, these bonuses are not doubled on a critical. For instance, if a creature\u2019s attack would typically deal 1d6+1 damage on a hit, they would instead deal 2d6+1 damage on a critical hit. The rules associated with critical hits do not apply to spells or cantrips. By default, a cantrip or spell which calls for an attack roll and has the capabilities to cause damage to a creature cannot be a critical hit. Healing # Unless it results in death, damage isn\u2019t permanent. Even death is reversible in some rare cases. Rest can restore a creature\u2019s Health, and magical or alchemical methods such as healing spells or healing potions can remove damage instantly. When a creature receives healing of any kind, Health they regain is added to their current Health. A creature\u2019s current Health can\u2019t exceed their maximum Health, so any Health regained in excess of a creature\u2019s maximum Health is lost. A creature that has died cannot regain Health. Range # You can only make attacks against targets within the specified range of the spell, ability, skill, or weapon you are using. The range of the attack you are using will be listed under that specific item or ability\u2019s description. If you are attacking a creature outside of a projectile\u2019s range with weaponry rather than a spell, you can still attempt to make an attack roll against them, but you must do so with disadvantage. Sometimes, a target may be so far away that an attempted attack may be impossible. The Guide determines whether or not a target is completely out of range of a projectile. Most creatures have a default melee range of 5 feet, meaning they can attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee or touch-based attack. Certain creatures have melee and touch-based attacks with a greater range than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions. Some melee weapons and items, such as spears, have an inherently longer melee range than others. Creature Size and Space # Each creature takes up an amount of space depending on their size. If a creature is a smaller or larger size than another creature, those creatures can occupy the same space in combat. For example, an average Adventurer whose size is medium could climb onto the body of a dragon, whose size is giant, and occupy the same space as that dragon. You cannot end your movement in the same space as another creature that is equal to your size. There are six sizes that a creature could be; tiny, small, medium, large, and giant. Creatures smaller than the smallest of adventurers are considered tiny, and creatures larger than the largest adventurers are considered giant. Sometimes, it may be necessary to carry an Unconscious creature. If such an occurrence arises, small creatures are 6 Bulk, medium creatures are 8 Bulk, and large creatures are 10 Bulk. Tiny creatures or creatures smaller than small sized weigh 4 Bulk. Advantage and Disadvantage # The terms advantage and disadvantage are used frequently throughout this manual and during gameplay to describe a certain special rule that is used primarily, but not exclusively, during combat encounters. The terms advantage and disadvantage are used in and outside of combat. Having advantage on an attack roll or check means to roll 2d20 and to use the higher number rolled as the result. Disadvantage is the opposite, meaning to roll 2d20 and to use the lower number rolled as the final roll result. Advantage or disadvantage can greatly increase or decrease the chance of success when making an attack roll or check. The Guide determines if and when a creature rolls with advantage or disadvantage. A number of skills and abilities can also grant a Adventurers with advantage or disadvantage depending on the specific activity they are attempting to succeed in. Free Actions and Reactions # Some skills, spells, and abilities can be used by a creature without that creature having to spend any Actions. These skills and abilities are called Free Actions, and they cost 0 Actions to perform. Sometimes, skills and other activities may only cost an Adventurer Stamina points instead of Actions. These sorts of activities are also considered Free Actions. In a combat round, creatures can only use a Free Action during their turn or after their turn in a round unless otherwise stated by a particular skill, spell, or ability. By default, there are no limits to the number of Free Actions a creature can perform during a single round of combat. Sometimes, creatures can use certain Free Actions regardless of whether or not their turn has happened yet. These kinds of Free Actions are called Reactions, and can be used in combat as a response to certain conditions being met or specific events taking place. As the name implies, Reactions are triggered as a response to a certain circumstance occurring. Reactions can only be used when their condition has been triggered. As long as the conditions occur for a Reaction to trigger, that Reaction can be used. As long as a creature\u2019s turn is happening or has already passed in a round, that creature can use Free Actions. Creatures who are Unconscious or Stunned cannot use Free Actions or Reactions, unless otherwise stated or implied by a certain skill or spell. Cover and Rough Terrain # Many aspects of the battlefield can hinder or aid combatants. The most common case of the environment affecting combat is cover. Walls, trees, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a creature more difficult to target with attacks. A creature can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. There are two types of cover; full cover and half cover. A creature with full cover cannot be targeted by an attack roll or spell, although some spells or skill effects can reach such a target by including them in an area of effect. A creature has full cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle. A creature with half cover is considered Covered, and gains a +3 bonus to their Defense as a result. A creature is Covered if an obstacle blocks or covers at least half of their body. This obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, or a tree trunk. Adventurers will sometimes find themselves in unfavorable tactical positions due to their battlefield, such as fighting in a swampy area or a room full of rubble. This kind of battlefield is called Rough terrain. While engaged in a combat encounter on Rough terrain, such as fighting in deep snow or while underwater, each combatant becomes Encumbered. Using Shields # Shields are carried by Adventurers to defend themselves against physical harm. They come in many shapes, sizes, and adornments. To benefit from a shield\u2019s Defense bonus, a creature must spend 1 Action to raise that shield against an attack targeting them. By default, a shield can only be used to defend the creature that is wielding it. A creature wielding a shield can use that shield for 1 Action to defend themselves during combat. A shield- wielding creature can raise a shield in this way preemptively, or as they are being attacked. A shield can even be used by a creature as that creature is in the process of being attacked. A creature can use a shield in this way even after that creature knows whether an attack roll made against them would hit or miss them. A creature who has raised their shield benefits from that shield\u2019s Defense bonus until they choose to lower or drop that shield as a Free Action. Lowering or dropping a shield can be done by any creature as a Free Action. A hand used to wield a shield is considered occupied. For this reason, no item can be wielded in the same hand that a shield is being wielded in by default, and no spells can be cast by a creature wielding a shield unless their other hand is free and unoccupied. Mortality and Death # Typically, only integral characters can fall Unconscious. Enemies and NPCs who are reduced to 0 Health die automatically. There can be exceptions to this rule at the Guide\u2019s discretion. Whenever an Adventurer falls Unconscious, however, they must begin making a special kind of check called a Mortality check. A Mortality check is made by rolling 1d20 against a DC of 10. If an Adventurer fails a Mortality check, they lose 1 Mortality and come one step closer to death. If they succeed, they do not lose a Mortality point. By default, each Adventurer has 3 Mortality points. These Mortality points represent an Adventurer\u2019s overall ability to cling to life. This process begins on an Adventurer\u2019s next turn in combat, after the turn in which they first become Unconscious. The Unconscious Adventurer then continues to make a Mortality check on each of their following turns until they become conscious or Stabilized. Mortality checks take up an Unconscious Adventurer\u2019s entire turn, and Unconscious Adventurers only make one Mortality check per turn. If an Adventurer rolls a natural 1 on their Mortality check, they lose 2 Mortality. If an Adventurer rolls a natural 20 on their Mortality check, they regain consciousness and 1 Health. An Adventurer who regains consciousness from scoring a natural 20 on a Mortality check cannot take their turn as normal after awakening, as a Mortality check already takes up an Adventurer\u2019s entire turn. If an Unconscious Adventurer is hit with a critical hit, they die instantly. 152The best and easiest way to help a dying Adventurer is to heal them. Healing an Unconscious Adventurer brings them back to consciousness immediately, and Health is applied to them as normal. If healing is not an option, certain Adventurers that possess the skills to do so could instead Stabilize their fallen companions. A Stabilized Adventurer remains Unconscious, but does not roll Mortality checks. Whether they are Stabilized or not, Unconscious Adventurers lose 1 Mortality and become unstabilized if they take any damage. Adventurers naturally regain their maximum Mortality points after each Rest. Once an Adventurer's Mortality is reduced to 0, that Adventurer dies. An Adventurer who dies is entitled to their last words.","title":"Combat"},{"location":"combat/#combat","text":"Combat encounters are violent conflicts between two or more opposing forces.

Any task a combatant wishes to perform that is not moving from one place to another or vocally communicating is considered an Action, not Speed. Climbing, going prone, vaulting over a small wall, opening a door, jumping, and similar activities are all considered Actions. The amount of Actions that a Guide-controlled combatant has access to in an encounter are determined by the Guide, while Adventurers have 2 Actions by default. If an Adventurer wishes to perform an activity in battle that is not listed in this manual's default rules, the Guide determines if the task is possible as well as how many Actions it will cost to perform this endeavor. The only tasks during combat that can be performed without using an Action are dropping items and speaking between other combatants. Dialogue never costs an Action, and players are encouraged to banter and roleplay amongst each other and their opponents during battle. Some tasks and abilities, such as casting certain spells, cost more than 1 Action to perform. There are also some skills and abilities that allow Adventurers to perform two activities using only 1 Action, such as the Warrior\u2019s Surge ability.","title":"Your Turn"},{"location":"combat/#common-actions","text":"There are a number of Actions that any creature or Adventurer can do that does not require any special abilities or skills. These tasks cost 1 Action to perform. If a task is not listed here, it is up to the Guide to determine how many Actions that task would cost to perform. Typically, performing any activity in the heat of battle costs a combatant 1 Action. The following is a list of activities that cost 1 Action to perform to serve as an example. Making an attack roll. Performing any activity that requires an ability check, such as making a Wit check to perceive your surroundings or a Might check to kick open a jammed door. Withdrawing or stowing an item or weapon. Raising a shield to defend oneself. Donning or doffing an adornment or piece of armor, such as a helmet or a ring. Falling prone, or standing up from the prone position. Consuming something, such as eating a bite of food or drinking a potion. Reloading a weapon that requires ammunition, such as a bow or a firearm.","title":"Common Actions"},{"location":"combat/#attack-rolls","text":"Whenever a combatant wishes to attack another creature, their attack roll determines whether their attack successfully deals any damage to their target. To make an attack roll, roll 1d20 against a DC of your target\u2019s Defense. By default, Adventurers do not add any bonuses to their attack rolls, and instead simply use the rolled result as the attack roll\u2019s total. If the total result of an attack roll equals or exceeds a target\u2019s Defense, the attack hits and deals damage to the target. If the total result of an attack roll does not meet a target\u2019s Defense, the target avoids the attack in some way and takes no damage. The Defense of an Adventurer is determined at character creation, whereas the Defense of an non-player target is determined by the Guide. There are a number of factors that could improve a creature\u2019s default Defense, such as wearing armor or casting a defensive spell.","title":"Attack Rolls"},{"location":"combat/#damage","text":"Injury and the risk of death are constant threats to Adventurers. Whenever a creature takes damage, that creature\u2019s Health is reduced by an amount equal to the damage dealt to it. The loss of Health has no effect on a creature\u2019s abilities until that creature is reduced to 0 Health. Each weapon, spell, and ability specifies the damage it deals, if any. The attacker always rolls the damage die to determine how much damage their target is dealt. Magical weapons, class abilities, and other factors could grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage to a target, but never negative damage. If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, the attacker only rolls the damage dice once to determine how much damage each target takes. If an Adventurer reduces a target to 0 Health using a melee weapon, that Adventurer can indicate that they wish to deal nonlethal damage to the target. If an Adventurer does this, the target becomes Unconscious and Stabilized instead of dying. It is possible for a creature to be killed instantly from an attack or circumstance which deals a massive amount of damage to them. If an Adventurer takes an amount of damage from one attack which equals or exceeds their maximum Health, they must make a Might check against a DC of 10 or die instantly.","title":"Damage"},{"location":"combat/#critical-hits-and-natural-ones","text":"Even experienced Adventurers make mistakes, and even novice Adventurers can be favored by fate. If an attack roll results in a roll of 20 before any modifiers are applied, that attack roll hits regardless of any bonuses, penalties, or the target\u2019s Defense. This is called a critical hit. If the d20 roll result for an attack roll is a 1, the attack roll misses regardless of any modifiers or the target\u2019s Defense. Rolling a 1 on an attack roll has no other special rules, but critical hits have a number of effects depending on what kind of attack is being made. If a weapon makes a critical hit, the damage dice used for that weapon attack roll is doubled. If a weapon typically does 1d6 damage, for instance, a critical hit with that weapon would deal 2d6. If the attack's damage has any bonuses attributed to it, these bonuses are not doubled on a critical. For instance, if a creature\u2019s attack would typically deal 1d6+1 damage on a hit, they would instead deal 2d6+1 damage on a critical hit. The rules associated with critical hits do not apply to spells or cantrips. By default, a cantrip or spell which calls for an attack roll and has the capabilities to cause damage to a creature cannot be a critical hit.","title":"Critical Hits and Natural Ones"},{"location":"combat/#healing","text":"Unless it results in death, damage isn\u2019t permanent. Even death is reversible in some rare cases. Rest can restore a creature\u2019s Health, and magical or alchemical methods such as healing spells or healing potions can remove damage instantly. When a creature receives healing of any kind, Health they regain is added to their current Health. A creature\u2019s current Health can\u2019t exceed their maximum Health, so any Health regained in excess of a creature\u2019s maximum Health is lost. A creature that has died cannot regain Health.","title":"Healing"},{"location":"combat/#range","text":"You can only make attacks against targets within the specified range of the spell, ability, skill, or weapon you are using. The range of the attack you are using will be listed under that specific item or ability\u2019s description. If you are attacking a creature outside of a projectile\u2019s range with weaponry rather than a spell, you can still attempt to make an attack roll against them, but you must do so with disadvantage. Sometimes, a target may be so far away that an attempted attack may be impossible. The Guide determines whether or not a target is completely out of range of a projectile. Most creatures have a default melee range of 5 feet, meaning they can attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee or touch-based attack. Certain creatures have melee and touch-based attacks with a greater range than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions. Some melee weapons and items, such as spears, have an inherently longer melee range than others.","title":"Range"},{"location":"combat/#creature-size-and-space","text":"Each creature takes up an amount of space depending on their size. If a creature is a smaller or larger size than another creature, those creatures can occupy the same space in combat. For example, an average Adventurer whose size is medium could climb onto the body of a dragon, whose size is giant, and occupy the same space as that dragon. You cannot end your movement in the same space as another creature that is equal to your size. There are six sizes that a creature could be; tiny, small, medium, large, and giant. Creatures smaller than the smallest of adventurers are considered tiny, and creatures larger than the largest adventurers are considered giant. Sometimes, it may be necessary to carry an Unconscious creature. If such an occurrence arises, small creatures are 6 Bulk, medium creatures are 8 Bulk, and large creatures are 10 Bulk. Tiny creatures or creatures smaller than small sized weigh 4 Bulk.","title":"Creature Size and Space"},{"location":"combat/#advantage-and-disadvantage","text":"The terms advantage and disadvantage are used frequently throughout this manual and during gameplay to describe a certain special rule that is used primarily, but not exclusively, during combat encounters. The terms advantage and disadvantage are used in and outside of combat. Having advantage on an attack roll or check means to roll 2d20 and to use the higher number rolled as the result. Disadvantage is the opposite, meaning to roll 2d20 and to use the lower number rolled as the final roll result. Advantage or disadvantage can greatly increase or decrease the chance of success when making an attack roll or check. The Guide determines if and when a creature rolls with advantage or disadvantage. A number of skills and abilities can also grant a Adventurers with advantage or disadvantage depending on the specific activity they are attempting to succeed in.","title":"Advantage and Disadvantage"},{"location":"combat/#free-actions-and-reactions","text":"Some skills, spells, and abilities can be used by a creature without that creature having to spend any Actions. These skills and abilities are called Free Actions, and they cost 0 Actions to perform. Sometimes, skills and other activities may only cost an Adventurer Stamina points instead of Actions. These sorts of activities are also considered Free Actions. In a combat round, creatures can only use a Free Action during their turn or after their turn in a round unless otherwise stated by a particular skill, spell, or ability. By default, there are no limits to the number of Free Actions a creature can perform during a single round of combat. Sometimes, creatures can use certain Free Actions regardless of whether or not their turn has happened yet. These kinds of Free Actions are called Reactions, and can be used in combat as a response to certain conditions being met or specific events taking place. As the name implies, Reactions are triggered as a response to a certain circumstance occurring. Reactions can only be used when their condition has been triggered. As long as the conditions occur for a Reaction to trigger, that Reaction can be used. As long as a creature\u2019s turn is happening or has already passed in a round, that creature can use Free Actions. Creatures who are Unconscious or Stunned cannot use Free Actions or Reactions, unless otherwise stated or implied by a certain skill or spell.","title":"Free Actions and Reactions"},{"location":"combat/#cover-and-rough-terrain","text":"Many aspects of the battlefield can hinder or aid combatants. The most common case of the environment affecting combat is cover. Walls, trees, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a creature more difficult to target with attacks. A creature can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. There are two types of cover; full cover and half cover. A creature with full cover cannot be targeted by an attack roll or spell, although some spells or skill effects can reach such a target by including them in an area of effect. A creature has full cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle. A creature with half cover is considered Covered, and gains a +3 bonus to their Defense as a result. A creature is Covered if an obstacle blocks or covers at least half of their body. This obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, or a tree trunk. Adventurers will sometimes find themselves in unfavorable tactical positions due to their battlefield, such as fighting in a swampy area or a room full of rubble. This kind of battlefield is called Rough terrain. While engaged in a combat encounter on Rough terrain, such as fighting in deep snow or while underwater, each combatant becomes Encumbered.","title":"Cover and Rough Terrain"},{"location":"combat/#using-shields","text":"Shields are carried by Adventurers to defend themselves against physical harm. They come in many shapes, sizes, and adornments. To benefit from a shield\u2019s Defense bonus, a creature must spend 1 Action to raise that shield against an attack targeting them. By default, a shield can only be used to defend the creature that is wielding it. A creature wielding a shield can use that shield for 1 Action to defend themselves during combat. A shield- wielding creature can raise a shield in this way preemptively, or as they are being attacked. A shield can even be used by a creature as that creature is in the process of being attacked. A creature can use a shield in this way even after that creature knows whether an attack roll made against them would hit or miss them. A creature who has raised their shield benefits from that shield\u2019s Defense bonus until they choose to lower or drop that shield as a Free Action. Lowering or dropping a shield can be done by any creature as a Free Action. A hand used to wield a shield is considered occupied. For this reason, no item can be wielded in the same hand that a shield is being wielded in by default, and no spells can be cast by a creature wielding a shield unless their other hand is free and unoccupied.","title":"Using Shields"},{"location":"combat/#mortality-and-death","text":"Typically, only integral characters can fall Unconscious. Enemies and NPCs who are reduced to 0 Health die automatically. There can be exceptions to this rule at the Guide\u2019s discretion. Whenever an Adventurer falls Unconscious, however, they must begin making a special kind of check called a Mortality check. A Mortality check is made by rolling 1d20 against a DC of 10. If an Adventurer fails a Mortality check, they lose 1 Mortality and come one step closer to death. If they succeed, they do not lose a Mortality point. By default, each Adventurer has 3 Mortality points. These Mortality points represent an Adventurer\u2019s overall ability to cling to life. This process begins on an Adventurer\u2019s next turn in combat, after the turn in which they first become Unconscious. The Unconscious Adventurer then continues to make a Mortality check on each of their following turns until they become conscious or Stabilized. Mortality checks take up an Unconscious Adventurer\u2019s entire turn, and Unconscious Adventurers only make one Mortality check per turn. If an Adventurer rolls a natural 1 on their Mortality check, they lose 2 Mortality. If an Adventurer rolls a natural 20 on their Mortality check, they regain consciousness and 1 Health. An Adventurer who regains consciousness from scoring a natural 20 on a Mortality check cannot take their turn as normal after awakening, as a Mortality check already takes up an Adventurer\u2019s entire turn. If an Unconscious Adventurer is hit with a critical hit, they die instantly. 152The best and easiest way to help a dying Adventurer is to heal them. Healing an Unconscious Adventurer brings them back to consciousness immediately, and Health is applied to them as normal. If healing is not an option, certain Adventurers that possess the skills to do so could instead Stabilize their fallen companions. A Stabilized Adventurer remains Unconscious, but does not roll Mortality checks. Whether they are Stabilized or not, Unconscious Adventurers lose 1 Mortality and become unstabilized if they take any damage. Adventurers naturally regain their maximum Mortality points after each Rest. Once an Adventurer's Mortality is reduced to 0, that Adventurer dies. An Adventurer who dies is entitled to their last words.","title":"Mortality and Death"},{"location":"companions/","text":"Companions # A number of varying skills can grant Adventurers with companions.

Adversaries come in all shapes and sizes. Monsters and other adversaries have no default statistics within the game. It is suggested that the Guide creates their own enemies to fit their unique setting. Creating enemies and monsters for your adventure is a simple task, as creatures in Hands of Ether always have the same types of statistics. Each creature, including each player-controlled Adventurer, has four primary ability scores and eight minor scores. For monsters, the eight minor scores are rarely used during combat and can be ignored when creating a monster\u2019s statistics. Each creature also has a primary ability and a number of skills or spells. For simplicity\u2019s sake, it is suggested that each enemy your Adventurer\u2019s face has three or less skills or spells in addition to their primary ability. Any more spells or skills could be too challenging to control during the confusion of running a smooth combat encounter. Crafting Enemies # To create a humanoid enemy to challenge your players with, simply create an appropriately leveled Adventurer. A challenge for a group of Adventurers is one enemy who is 1 level above them. A few level 2 enemies are a fair challenge to a group of four or less level 1 player-controlled Adventurers. You can create monsters in this manner as well, but with much less limitation. As an example, a hag that a group of Adventurers are battling may have a few Witch skills and a few Rogue skills, creating a unique and powerful creature who specializes in both dark magic and subterfuge. The two most important scores to consider when creating a custom enemy is their Health and Defense. Scores other than Health and Defense could be used, but it is not necessary. The Defense of an enemy creature can be determined by considering their size as well as any armoring they may possess. A giant is a big target, and therefore should be easier to hit. A Defense of 8 is a good starting score for such a creature. A dragon, however, has natural armor in the form of thick scales. For this reason, a dragon may have a Defense of 12 despite their size. Health is the most important factor when creating an enemy. To determine an appropriate amount of Health for a custom enemy, add each of your Adventurer\u2019s levels together and then multiple by three. (Three level 10 Adventurers = 30. 30 x 3 = 90). 90 Health is an appropriate amount of Health for a fair but challenging encounter for three level 10 Adventurers. Although creating your own monsters and enemies is suggested, this manual also contains a number of monsters and enemies to challenge your Adventurers with. The following creatures can be used as a guideline to help you design and create your own adversaries, as well. Each enemy in this manual has a unique property called a Challenge Rating (CR). This is a score used to judge how difficult a monster is to defeat in combat, and is directly related to the current level of the adventuring party. A Challenge Rating of 1, for example, is considered a challenging but manageable enemy for a group of three level 1 Adventurers to battle. Each of the following enemies also has a weakness. Weaknesses are secret vulnerabilities of a creature that can greatly assist Adventurers in battle. Weaknesses could be revealed to the party through a Sage\u2019s Discern ability, or through the party searching old libraries for answers on how to best defeat their enemy. Situational Encounters # Sometimes Adventurers may face a foe that is not a typical monster or group of bandits. Natural disasters, mobs of angry villagers, or swarms of rats work just like other adversaries in this game. They have Health, skills, and other statistics. Guides are free to create their own unconventional encounters just as they would any other monster, but the following list of prepared adversaries contains a few examples of such circumstantial challenges. Wrong Elf # Twisted in the darkness, the once proud and intellectually advanced Athaki have become a primal, ferocious shadow of their former selves. They now wander the caverns beneath the surface in small clusters, surviving day by day and using scavenged weaponry to catch spelunkers, treasure hunters, and miners by surprise. These pallid, conal-headed gremlins rely on guerrilla tactics to gain an edge, and are constantly in a state of desperation as they struggle to survive in the forgotten halls of their once great civilization. Their spherical black eyes and bleached blue skin is a fearsome sight, but they are weak and fragile creatures on their own. Wrong-Elves are rarely seen alone, and are never encountered in the daylight or on the surface. The Wrong-elves have an obsession with trinkets of a technological nature; an instinctual echo of their ancestor\u2019s once curious and enterprising nature. Challenge Rating 1 Type Shadow Agility +1 Might -3 Will -3 Wit +1 Actions 2 Health 5 Defense 10 Speed 40 Size Small Primary Ability: Venom Soaked Shot The Wrong-Elf spends 1 Action to make an attack roll against an Adventurer within 100 feet. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 damage and must succeed a Might check against a DC of 5 or become Sapped until their next Rest. Dark Vision. Wrong-Elves can see in darkness out to a range of 50 feet as if the area was not obscured. Entangling Net. Wrong-Elves can spend 1 Action to toss a net at an Adventurer in an attempt to restrain them. The target must succeed an Agility check against a DC of 8 or become Restrained until the end of the next round. Pack Tactics. Wrong-elves have advantage on any attack roll made against an Adventurer that is within 5 feet of another conscious Wrong-Elf. Tavern # An interwoven, flailing sea of greasy, weathered limbs and broken glass. If an Adventurer starts trouble in a tavern, weary and bored townsfolk will leap at any opportunity to escalate their local drinking hole\u2019s entropy in the name of entertainment alone. A pub fight is not typically a lethal encounter, unless the offense is worthy of execution or some ill-fated accident occurs in the confusion, but it can be a challenging one to most Adventurers. Adventurers who get knocked out by the Tavern Brawl awaken in less than fortunate conditions. If all Adventurers in the party are knocked out before they reduce the Brawl to 0 Health, they awaken in the settlement\u2019s prison, and are Exhausted. The Adventurer\u2019s prison sentence is 1d4 days. Challenge Rating 3 Type Situation Agility 0 Might 0 Will 0 Wit 0 Actions 1 Health 40 Defense 10 Speed 10 Size Giant Primary Ability: Brawl At the beginning of each round, the Brawl can attack each Adventurer as a Free Action. Each target must make the Guide\u2019s choice of an ability check against a DC of 10. Adventurers who fail take 1d4 damage as they are caught in the chaotic violence of the Brawl. If an Adventurer fails this initial check, they must then succeed a Might check against a DC of 8 or get knocked out. An Adventurer who reaches 0 Health or is knocked out by this ability becomes Unconscious and Stabilized. The Brawl will no longer attack an Adventurer who has become Unconscious. 19 Weakness: A slippery floor can cause some tavern brawlers to fall over and call it quits. Throwing a slippery substance to the floor of the tavern reduces the Tavern Brawl\u2019s Health by 10. Furrowed Brows and Clenched Fists. The Tavern Brawl cannot kill an Adventurer, and Adventurers cannot reduce the Tavern Brawl\u2019s Health through typical means. On each of an Adventurer\u2019s turns, they must spend their turn performing an activity they think will incapacitate a few of the volatile drunks that make up the brawling mass. Then, that Adventurer must make a relative ability check of the Guide\u2019s choice against a DC of 12. On a success, the Tavern Brawl\u2019s Health is reduced by 5. When the Tavern Brawl\u2019s Health reaches 0, the brawl becomes subdues and ends. An Accident. The Tavern Brawl can use this skill once per encounter. A drunken Fir knocks over a barrel of flammable spirits while a swaying, clumsy Dwarf spills their own spirit\u2019s contents in a line leading from the fireplace to the opened barrel. At the beginning of the target's next turn, the trail of fire will reach the puddle of flammable spirits. An Adventurer must spend their entire turn extinguishing or halting this trail of fire using their surroundings, items, or abilities before the end of the next round. The Adventurer attempting to stop the flames must succeed a relative ability check against a DC of 10. If the fire reaches the flammable spirits before an Adventurer can stop it, each Adventurer must succeed a Might check against a DC of 10 or become knocked out, Unconscious, and Stabilized. Haymaker. The Tavern Brawl can use this skill once per encounter. A surly dwarven woman with faded tattoos and a horned helm leaps from the fray and slams her stony fist directly into the face of one of the Adventurers. It feels like hitting a brick wall while galloping on horseback. The afflicted Adventurer must succeed a Might check against a DC of 18 or become Unconscious and Stabilized. Once the afflicted Adventurer later awakens, they become Sapped until their next Rest. Rotter # A mysterious band of tribal monsters with spongy white skin stretched over their otherwise humanoid bodies. They grow in strength with each kill, covering the bodies of their slain enemies with fungal microbes that possess and assimilate them. The Rot Runners each retain muddled memories of who they once were, and have even been known to hold and adorn themselves with weaponry and armor. Most notably, they have been observed collecting memorabilia from their former lives and creating effigies with these scavenged items deep in the wilderness. They adorn themselves with the blood of their enemies, painting themselves with dark red spirals to strike fear into the hearts of their prey. Challenge Rating 1 Type Pale Agility +2 Might -3 Will +2 Wit -1 Actions 2 Health 10 Defense 8 Speed 30 Size Small or Medium Primary Ability: Brutal Rend The Rotter spends 1 Action to slash at an Adventurer with its cleaver.

In addition, 1 nonmagical item of the Rotter\u2019s choice which is being wielded by the target becomes Broken. Meat Mite Swarm # Flying, crawling, insectoid creatures which move as one, constantly burrowing into, eating into, mating with, and birthing each other. Their soft crimson exoskeletons are constantly dripping with a toxic serum not unlike blood, and they seek only to overrun and consume flesh. They are blind, and fervently sense out for the smell of meat using their razor sharp mandibles, which also act as their antenna. Challenge Rating 2 Type Situation Agility +3 Might -3 Will -3 Wit -1 Actions 1 Health 20 Defense 8 Speed 50 Size Medium Primary Ability: Red Fog The Swarm can occupy the same space as any other creature, and must do so to attack a creature. The swarm can spend 1 Action while sharing a space with another creature to eat at that creature\u2019s skin. The target takes 1d4 damage and must succeed a Might check or become Bleeding. Weakness: A fire-based or holy attack or spell which hits the Mite Swarm causes it to die. One Thousand Mouths. The Swarm cannot be damaged by any attack that requires the attacker to make an attack roll. The Swarm can only take damage from spells, skills, or abilities which cause the Swarm to make an ability check in order to evade damage. Putrid Scent. At the beginning of each round, all creatures within 10 feet of the Swarm must succeed a Might check against a DC of 10. Creatures who fail this check become Sapped by the crimson flock\u2019s rancid smell until their next Rest. Grim Shaman # These hulking shamans of the swamps and forests appear as hunched humanoids with dull exoskeletons and faces locked into mournful expressions. They utilize simple magical powers they draw from their fey nature to attack intruders. Purely malicious, they often revel in their prey\u2019s pain, and will hang half-dead humanoids on poles as a threat to others that encroach on their territory. They have an eerie artistry to them, carving wind chimes from the bones of creatures they torture and kill, or creating scarecrows using the skin of people unfortunate enough to cross paths with them. Challenge Rating 2 Type Fey Agility -3 Might +4 Will +2 Wit +1 Actions 2 Health 30 Defense 8 Speed 20 Size Large Primary Ability: Toxic Spew The Grim Shaman spends 1 Action to spew a paralyzing venom from the top of its head in a 50 foot radius.

Lizard Wizard # These slimy, gaunt humanoids have long reptilian snouts, scaly skin, and wide yellow eyes. Their bestial instincts are overridden by their affinity for the dark arts and their morbid curiosity. They work deep below the earth in small groups, constantly pursuing power through evil rituals and eldritch practices. They are known to steal magic artifacts from arcane colleges and kidnap powerful wizards to force them to spill their secrets. They wear simple robs and headdresses made from stolen arcane artifacts. innately evil, they are always looking for vulnerable creatures to capture and perform vile experiment on.

It obsessively collects bodies and body parts either of creatures it ambushes and kills in a brutal fashion or discarded bodies it comes across. It hordes the bodies it finds in the dark and dust of empty cathedrals and temples. Despite its very instinctual movements and compulsions, it seems to harbor some semblance of intelligence. It is often spotted digging into graves and exploring catacombs in its desperate search to find new, interesting bodies to collect. The Necroid always has 1d6 corpses around it at all times, which it can raise as a Zombie Minion by using its Raise Dead ability.

The carnivorous beast has four glistening eyes and a pincer-like maw used for seeking out and rending flesh. Scrabblers are intelligent, and have an affinity for collecting treasures from the surface world in an attempt to appease their unending curiosity.

Abandoned by their dead god, these orphans of malice and chaos seek to wipe all of creation away. With no guiding force, however, they have become wayward orphans who fear the retaliation of the mortals. Titans live forever if left alone, but can die if killed by another creature. They are insular, living their violent and dark lives in the bowels of canyons and caves. Titans are heavily indoctrinated in their contempt and hatred, and cannot be reasoned with.

Its body is covered in pastel fur that oozes with a paralyzing toxin, and its alien head is constantly swiveling around in search of trinkets to steal and flesh to consume. A prehensile tongue wrapped in its slobbering maw is used to restrain and capture not only sustenance, but items and items that the Slythen finds fascinating. The Slythen has an instinctual and unbridled compulsion to hoard. Being compulsive in its collecting and nomadic in its lifestyle, it has evolved a cavity within its caterpillar-like body to store its stolen belongings. This cavity runs down the entirety of the Slythen\u2019s frame.

Fur Hags will kidnap children, lynch innocent villagers during the night, poison a town\u2019s water, or corrupt nearby animals in their attempts to cause a settlement disease and paranoia. Fur Hags value self-preservation, however, and are not typically bold in their plots. These evil acts can sometimes take place months apart from each other, but are more often than not done in a pattern of some kind due to the Fur Hag\u2019s necessity for feeding off a population\u2019s negative emotional energy.

The creature is able to warp reality around itself to terrifying extents, and innately able to cast dark spells from its tentacles. A singular large eye stares ahead from within the Horror\u2019s floating form, unblinking and perpetually seeking out its next source of nourishment to sustain its unending hunger for flesh and fear. Three other eyes are sunken into pockets of flesh at the tip of each of its tentacles, which dangle from underneath its gargantuan form.

The Ichor Lord takes on qualities of its host, and often exaggerates them, creating a new personality for itself. This ironic corruption serves as both a means of terrorizing innocent mortals and to entertain the Ichor Lord itself. The Ichor Lord causes corruption, insanity, decay, disease, infection, repulsion, and illness with no remorse, and has no qualms about its place in the world. It consideres its role in the world to be a divine art, but has no ego. It knows what it lusts after and appreciates the journey to it. It would rather ruin the lives of innocent mortals and revel in their suffering than kill them.

They often utilizevastnetworksof ruthlesslydeterminedminions to act out their will on the surface. These minions are sometimes cunning and powerful themselves, working in unison with the Crystal Dragon in exchange for a promised sliver of greater power. Most of the minions, however, give into the Dragon\u2019s cruelty and foreboding presence, viewing their servitude as the only path of escape from the Crystal Dragon\u2019s maddening influence. The Crystal Dragons come in many shapes and shades, but are always heavily encrusted with chunks of raw minerals that grow from their scales. These crystals grow in whatever manner the dragon wishes, and are often twisted into jagged crowns atop the dragon\u2019s head - a symbol of their twisted egomania.

Adversaries come in all shapes and sizes. Monsters and other adversaries have no default statistics within the game. It is suggested that the Guide creates their own enemies to fit their unique setting. Creating enemies and monsters for your adventure is a simple task, as creatures in Hands of Ether always have the same types of statistics. Each creature, including each player-controlled Adventurer, has four primary ability scores and eight minor scores. For monsters, the eight minor scores are rarely used during combat and can be ignored when creating a monster\u2019s statistics. Each creature also has a primary ability and a number of skills or spells. For simplicity\u2019s sake, it is suggested that each enemy your Adventurer\u2019s face has three or less skills or spells in addition to their primary ability. Any more spells or skills could be too challenging to control during the confusion of running a smooth combat encounter.","title":"Encounters"},{"location":"encounters/#crafting-enemies","text":"To create a humanoid enemy to challenge your players with, simply create an appropriately leveled Adventurer. A challenge for a group of Adventurers is one enemy who is 1 level above them. A few level 2 enemies are a fair challenge to a group of four or less level 1 player-controlled Adventurers. You can create monsters in this manner as well, but with much less limitation. As an example, a hag that a group of Adventurers are battling may have a few Witch skills and a few Rogue skills, creating a unique and powerful creature who specializes in both dark magic and subterfuge. The two most important scores to consider when creating a custom enemy is their Health and Defense. Scores other than Health and Defense could be used, but it is not necessary. The Defense of an enemy creature can be determined by considering their size as well as any armoring they may possess. A giant is a big target, and therefore should be easier to hit. A Defense of 8 is a good starting score for such a creature. A dragon, however, has natural armor in the form of thick scales. For this reason, a dragon may have a Defense of 12 despite their size. Health is the most important factor when creating an enemy. To determine an appropriate amount of Health for a custom enemy, add each of your Adventurer\u2019s levels together and then multiple by three. (Three level 10 Adventurers = 30. 30 x 3 = 90). 90 Health is an appropriate amount of Health for a fair but challenging encounter for three level 10 Adventurers. Although creating your own monsters and enemies is suggested, this manual also contains a number of monsters and enemies to challenge your Adventurers with. The following creatures can be used as a guideline to help you design and create your own adversaries, as well. Each enemy in this manual has a unique property called a Challenge Rating (CR). This is a score used to judge how difficult a monster is to defeat in combat, and is directly related to the current level of the adventuring party. A Challenge Rating of 1, for example, is considered a challenging but manageable enemy for a group of three level 1 Adventurers to battle. Each of the following enemies also has a weakness. Weaknesses are secret vulnerabilities of a creature that can greatly assist Adventurers in battle. Weaknesses could be revealed to the party through a Sage\u2019s Discern ability, or through the party searching old libraries for answers on how to best defeat their enemy.","title":"Crafting Enemies"},{"location":"encounters/#situational-encounters","text":"Sometimes Adventurers may face a foe that is not a typical monster or group of bandits.

There are a number of concepts, however, that a Guide should familiarize themselves with in order to better simulate the nature of the world during moments of improvisation. A Guide should strive to always be ready to improvise a ruling based on the particular situations their players are experiencing. Let the Adventurer\u2019s actions and your own common sense drive your rulings and story. The following tools can aid you in those times of improvisation, to better understand how the game functions, and to find more joy in your role as a Guide to adventure. The Guide's Role # As the Guide, you are the driving force behind the adventure. You act as a mediator for fairness and order between the players and their challenges, as well as the crafter of those challenges. You act as the narrator and host of the adventure. You inhabit and embody each and every creature and character within the world that isn\u2019t controlled by the players. Beyond presenting the setting of the adventure, you will also act as the judge and interpreter of the game\u2019s rules and the game world\u2019s properties. This game belongs to you and your players. Consider the entirety of this manual a long and intricate list of suggestions, and nothing more. No one knows your players, your table, your plans, or your idea of fun better than you do. This manual serves merely as a means of inspiration. Above all else, you and your player\u2019s own enjoyment of the game should be your primary concern. Bend, twist, and break these rules to fit your needs. If something doesn\u2019t work, change it. If you don\u2019t like something, scrap it. Be adaptable, be ever attentive to your player\u2019s needs, and remember that this entire manual should be viewed as a malleable tool for the purpose of entertaining your players and yourself, rather than a strict code of operation. Materials Required to Play # It is highly suggested that Guides first read through the Adventurer rules found throughout this manual. It is integral that you understand your player\u2019s mechanics and capabilities as a frame of reference for crafting your story and challenges. Beyond this manual, you will only need a set of die, pencils, paper, and your imagination. These are the only tools required to run the game. It is suggested to all Guides that they use a screen; some form of vertical barrier made of wood, cardboard, or another similar material to block their player\u2019s line of sight so that no secrets within the Guide\u2019s notes are revealed or spoiled to the players. The screen also serves the purpose of separating the Guide and the Adventurers to create an environment of mystery, and to allow for the Guide to roll dice with ease, privacy, and space. Difficulty Checks # The most common mechanic Adventurers will use to overcome obstacles is to perform an a check. Checks are made by rolling 1d20 and adding an ability score modifier to the rolled result. Some rules clearly indicate a minimum result that is required to succeed, but the Guide will often have to decide through improvisation and their own judgment what the threshold for success is dependent on the activity attempted by an Adventurer. This threshold is called a difficulty class (DC), and should be based on the difficulty of the action. The Guide should never reveal the odds of success or failure, and instead only narrate the outcome of the check. DC 4 A simple activity. DC 8 An average activity. DC 12 A challenging activity. DC 16 A heroic endeavor. DC 20 A mythic act. Hands of Ether uses four ability scores to represent the strengths and weaknesses of a creature\u2019s attributes. Although this simplifies game play, the condensed nature of these scores and their values can be somewhat murky and generalized. To give you an idea of what each ability score represents, and to help you decide which kind of check to instigate during gameplay, here are a few examples of activities and their associated ability checks. Examples of Agility Checks; Stealth, Reflexes, and Dexterity # Picking a lock. Walking a tightrope. Dodging a projectile. Hiding. Leaping over a wide gap. Cheating while gambling. Examples of Might Checks; Strength, Constitution, and Physical Health # Resisting a poison. Lifting a boulder. Kicking open a door. Holding your breath. Carrying a body. Examples of Will Checks; Charisma, Willpower, and Morale # Resisting psychic effects. Telling a lie. Bartering. Fighting off a possession from an evil spirit. Convincing an enemy to betray their allies. Keeping your hand submerged in icy water. Examples of Wit Checks; Knowledge, Wisdom, and Cunning # Navigating the wilderness. Remembering obscure lore. Seeing through a disguise. Investigating a room. Tracking a creature through the wilderness. An Adventurer's Resources # The Adventurers will overcome many tribulations as they progress that will slowly drain their resources. It is important that the Guide attempts to keep track of two of these dwindling resources during the course of a game session. An Adventurer\u2019s Health and Stamina are their lifeblood in the world of Hands of Ether; they live and die by these two scores in a very literal sense. Unless the Guide wishes to run an especially challenging game, they should aim to stay aware of how much Health and Stamina each Adventurer has remaining. If the Adventurers are running low on either of these resources, it may be a good idea to stop issuing any new challenges to them. Provide opportunities for the Adventurers to escape their current situation or find temporary respite. An old tavern in the woods or an abandoned ruin in a cavern can not only give great relief to hurt and tired Adventurers, but also act as opportunities to allow them to have interesting moments of roleplay. Managing Stamina # Adventurers can lose Stamina from using their abilities and skills, or as a natural result of performing adventurous endeavors. Losing Stamina from general activity, however, should be a rare occurrence. Stamina should only be lost in this way if an Adventurer performs an overly strenuous activity, such as... Climbing up a steep vertical cliff for half an hour or more. Lifting an extremely heavy item for an extended amount of time, such as the roof of a collapsing building. Sprinting for half an hour. Carrying a ridiculous amount of weight for a long period of time, such as remaining Encumbered for an entire day. Halting a stampeding animal through sheer strength alone. Becoming severely cold or hot due to harsh environmental conditions, such as camping without blankets in a tundra, or moving around in a flaming building. Failing to eat or drink for a few days. Rejecting the creeping grasp of sleep for a few days in order to stay on guard against threats in a dark and endless series of unending dungeon corridors. Understanding Damage # Differing degrees of damage and their associated damage dice can be a confusing concept for a Guide, especially when attempting to determine how much damage a custom creature or weapon should deal to Adventurers. Keep in mind that damage in Hands of Ether is not arbitrary; each point of damage a creature takes represents one cut, one scrape, one laceration. Health in Hands of Ether is literally a creature\u2019s vitality. To take a single point of damage is a dangerous and meaningful blow to a creature. The following is a list of examples to help you understand the correct level of damages to deal to creatures in certain situations. d4 Being cut with a small knife. Having a heavy hammer slammed into your shoulder. Being sprayed with a few pieces of shrapnel. d6 Being gashed by a sword. Being bludgeoned with a hammer. Suffering from a broken finger. d8 Being gored by a maul. Suffering from a blow powerful enough to knock someone to the ground. Suffering a broken wrist or ankle. d10 Being shot by a large firearm. Having your head caved in. Suffering from a broken arm or leg. d12 Being impaled. Having a limb severed or crushed. Suffering from a cracked or broken skull. 2d10 Being struck by lightning. Being shot with a cannon ball. Being trampled by stampeding animals. Falling into or becoming submerged by lava. Challenges of Adventuring # There are a number of hindrances and dangers your Adventurers could face other than combating their enemies. The key to a truly harrowing and challenging adventure is to pit your party against problems as well as enemies. The forces of nature itself, for instance, can be more of a challenge than a band of raiders, and can lend your players interesting opportunities to roleplay and get creative. Think outside the box - what could be interesting problems for your Adventurers in the current environment they find themselves in? In a jungle filled with insects and boggy water, your Adventurers may contract a disease such as the White Scourge - a supernatural plague that causes a creature to lose twice as much Mana or Stamina as they normally would. Remember to be fair - a Might check against a DC of 10 can be made to fight off a disease trying to take hold. In a politically strained town, the Adventurers may have to help the mayor and the merchants resolve their differences before they can buy enough supplies to travel on. Solving social problems with cunning words and successful Wit checks can be just as challenging and rewarding to Adventurers as a fierce battle could be. Rewards for Your Adventures # Players are driven by rewards, and Guides will often find joy in granting them. Rewards should always be granted, within narrative reason, to represent the spoils of overcoming adversity in the game. Rewards can also be a valuable tool to push the game\u2019s story forward. Players find satisfaction in a number of diverse ways. Forming a relationship with a favored NPC, opening their own tavern, or saving their hometown from marauders are all examples of narrative rewards. More often than not, however, rewards come in the form of level advancement or discovering new loot. Level Advancement # The Guide is free to decide when their Adventurers level up, but it is recommended that they reward Adventurers with advancements in level each time the players successfully overcome an adventuring milestone. Such milestones could be important character development events, successful battles against powerful foes, or the resolution of major conflicts. A few felled goblins is no reason to level up an adventuring party. Encountering wild and malevolent creatures should be a day to day occurrence for a typical Adventurer. Level 10 is the suggested maximum level for Adventurers. Therefore, leveling up should be a rare but thrilling occurrence. Make sure to level up Adventurers from a narratively significant, triumphant occasion, such as... The party survived a harrowing encounter with a violent and vile gang of criminals. The party has defeated Kragmal the Cruel in combat, saving the quaint village of Snake Run from enslavement. The party has escaped the labyrinthine crypt. The party has discovered a secret prophecy that threatens all of mortal kind, and have set out from their humble homestead to check the world from this vastly unknown threat. The party has stopped the wildfire from reaching the secret Moon Temple hidden in the druid\u2019s woodlands. The party survived being stranded on an abandoned island, and has successfully escaped on their makeshift raft. The party has taken the necromancer\u2019s keep as their own, effectively forming a base of operations and a new home for their adventuring group. The party has finally ended the threat of civil war by playing an expert game of political manipulation. In the end, the Guide decides the pace of level advancement. Hands of Ether is structured to be flexible in the amount of time spent playing a campaign. You could impose a level advancement in each session played, or keep the Adventurers at level 1 throughout the entirety of the campaign to maintain a more survivalistic game filled with tension. Hands of Ether runs just as well with a group of level 10 PCs throughout an entire campaign as it does with gradual level advancements throughout an entire campaign. Level advancements or the lack thereof can be a powerful tool for the setting and tone of your desired campaign or game. But keep in mind that players as a whole view leveling up as a reward and incentive, and the power to level up should never be completely robbed from them. Narrative Deviation # Beyond typical gameplay, there will often come times when the story and the narrative that you have weaved and created with your players takes an unexpected turn. This should be a common occurrence, in fact, as it is always suggested that Guides prepare adversaries and situations rather than premade encounters or plot points. Hands of Ether offers a number of improvisational narrative tools that the Guide can take advantage of in order to facilitate the circumstances of a free-flowing story. For various reasons, an Adventurer in a party may decide to deviate from their group\u2019s path for an extended period of time during the story. If and when such a thing occurs, the Guide and the player must have a session alone and separate from the Rest of the group to determine what the Adventurer does during their separate quest. The Guide, in this case, will present the player with narration and scenarios that could span hours, days, or weeks in-game. The Adventurer will describe what they wish to do during these time periods, and will react in a generalized and quickened manner compared to the more small-scope, default style of playing the game. The Guide may instigate checks during this time of narrative acceleration, but should do so rarely and sparingly. No dice should be used during a narrative deviation except for 1d20. An Adventurer should have a low chance of harm during a narrative deviation, but should come back from the encounter with something to show for it. Whether it be a magical trinket, a serious injury, or a divine boon, something must be gained during a narrative deviation to reward the Adventurer and player for their time of roleplay. This narrative tool works great for players who have missed a group\u2019s session for one reason or another. Epilogues # When the adventure comes to an end, the Adventurers should sit and discuss with their Guide what they wish for their retired Adventurers to do afterwards. A Cleric may decide to build a temple of their god, whereas a Witch may journey off into the wilderness and become a hermit. These details may affect the world in a future campaign, or may act as a form of closure for the Adventurers after their tale has come to an end. Regardless, it is integral to see where the Adventurers of the story end up, and what their true finality is for the sake of the players, the world, and the story.","title":"Guide Resources"},{"location":"guideresources/#guide","text":"Most knowledge, rules, and mechanics a Guide will need to understand before running the game are already heavily discussed in former chapters of this manual.

Checks are made by rolling 1d20 and adding an ability score modifier to the rolled result. Some rules clearly indicate a minimum result that is required to succeed, but the Guide will often have to decide through improvisation and their own judgment what the threshold for success is dependent on the activity attempted by an Adventurer. This threshold is called a difficulty class (DC), and should be based on the difficulty of the action. The Guide should never reveal the odds of success or failure, and instead only narrate the outcome of the check. DC 4 A simple activity. DC 8 An average activity. DC 12 A challenging activity. DC 16 A heroic endeavor. DC 20 A mythic act. Hands of Ether uses four ability scores to represent the strengths and weaknesses of a creature\u2019s attributes. Although this simplifies game play, the condensed nature of these scores and their values can be somewhat murky and generalized.

Some Adventurers rely on these items more than others, such as a Warrior\u2019s weaponry. Others are able to create and fabricate items to aid themselves and their companions. Adventurers must have a proficiency in a type of weaponry or form of protection in order to be able to use them. A proficiency in magic is not required to use items that are enchanted. Enchanted weapons, shields, and armor can be used by any Adventurer as long as they are proficient in that form of weaponry or protection. Most items cost 1 Action to use. The exceptions to this rule is armor, which is automatically and passively used if it is being worn, and ranged weaponry, which requires 1 Action to reload before being used to attack again. Combat Gear # Shield Use: 1 Action Defense Bonus: +2 Bulk: 1 Target, crested, buckler, tower; shields come in many shapes, sizes, and design. Adventurers can raise their shield for 1 Action to add that shield\u2019s Defense bonus to their total current Defense. Armor Use: Passive Defense Bonus: +2 Bulk: 2 Whether they prefer leather, plate, or chainmail, all Adventurers can find security while wearing a protective suit of armor. Wearing armor increases an Adventurer\u2019s Defense by 2. Light Melee Weapon Use: 1 Action Damage: 1d6 Range: 5 feet Bulk: 1 Daggers, short swords, maces, spiked gauntlets; each Adventurer has a different preference when dealing with threats in a dungeon. Light melee weapons occupy one of the wielder\u2019s hands. Heavy Melee Weapon Use: 1 Action Damage: 1d8 Range: 5 feet Bulk: 2 Some Adventurers prefer to wield hefty, two handed weapons. A heavy melee weapon could be a massive warhammer or an over-sized flail. Heavy melee weapons occupy both of the wielder\u2019s hands. Ranged Weapon Use: 1 Action Damage: 1d6 Range: 100 feet Bulk: 1 Bows, crossbows, or slingshots are some examples of ranged weapons. Sometimes it's best not to get too close to your enemies. ranged weapons are a safer alternative, but are slower to use than other weapons due to their need to be reloaded with an Action after each attack. Reach Weapon Use: 1 Action Damage: 1d6 Range: 10 feet Bulk: 2 Spears, halberds, warhammers, tridents, and other long-handled weaponry have an extended reach and are favored by those that live a martial lifestyle. They are considered reach weapons in terms of proficiency and crafting. Improvised Weapon Use: 1 Action Damage: 1d4 Range: 5 feet Bulk: 1 Sometimes a fire poker or a shovel is all an Adventurer has to defend themselves with. The Guide determines whether or not an Adventurer is proficient with a certain improvised weapon. Firearms # These rare ranged weapons are a technological marvel which use a combination of gunpowder, intricate metalwork, and alchemical combustion to launch shells and balls of iron at a target to devastating effects. Like all ranged weapons, firearms take 1 Action to reload. Some firearms, however, hold more ammunition at a time than typical ranged weapons. Firearms with larger ammunition capacities still take 1 Action to reload, but do not have to be reloaded until they have been completely depleted of ammunition. Due to these weapons not being completely perfected, they are often prone to malfunctions. Each firearm has a unique property called a \u201cmisfire rate\u201d. Whenever a wielder of a firearm rolls a natural roll result of a firearm\u2019s misfire or lower on their attack roll, the firearm becomes Broken. If an Adventurer does not possess a skill to fix a Broken firearm, they may need to seek out a powerful artificer within the world to fix their broken weapon in exchange for Coin. Flintlock Use: 1 Action Damage: 1d6 Range: 50 feet Ammunition Capacity: 1 Misfire: 3 Bulk: 1 A simple gunpowder pistol used by bandits and thieves. The device is more intimidating than useful. Musket Use: 1 Action Damage: 1d8 Range: 100 feet Ammunition Capacity: 4 Misfire: 4 Bulk: 2 A simple gunpowder rifle used by sharpshooters and militant factions as both a sign of power and organization. Revolver Use: 1 Action Damage: 1d8 Range: 100 feet Ammunition Capacity: 3 Misfire: 3 Bulk: 1 Made of wood, mithril, or steel, these complex firearms have a rotating chamber to allow a larger ammunition capacity. Most are family heirlooms passed down from a greater time. Special Weapons # These special weapons are just as rare and rewarding to come across as magical items in some cases. The following is a list of a few items that can be found within the world of Hands of Ether that do not fall into any of the default weapon categories. Ballista Use: 1 Action Damage: 2d10 Range: 120 feet Ammunition Capacity: 1 Bulk: 8 This large siege weapon fires a massive bolt that can puncture an enemy for an immense amount of damage. The weapon requires 2 creatures to lift and move it, and must be placed on the ground to fire. In addition, it costs 2 Actions to reload the ballista. Ballistae are considered ranged weapons for the purpose of proficiencies. Bomb Use: 1 Action Damage: 2d4 Range: 100 feet Bulk: 1 These simple bulbs of gunpowder have a hempen fuse that can be lit, allowing the wielder to toss the device before it explodes and peppers enemies with fire and shrapnel. This weapon is considered a ranged weapon. On a hit, a bomb deals 2d4 damage to both the target and any other creatures within 10 feet of the target. Boomerang Use: 1 Action, 1 Action to catch Damage: 1d6 Range: 50 feet Bulk: 1 These curved wooden weapons are used to bludgeon enemies from a distance. After each attack, the boomerang will curve through the air and return to its wielder\u2019s hand if the wielder\u2019s attack roll is successful. Boomerangs are considered ranged weapons for the purpose of proficiencies and crafting. Breaker Blade Use: 1 Action Damage: 1d4 Defense Bonus: 1 Range: Touch Bulk: 1 These short, jagged blades are known as parrying daggers in some circles, and can be used to fend off attacker by catching and or disabling their weapons. Breakers can be used either to attack or to defend at the cost of 1 Action. If the breaker successfully defends against an attack roll, the wielder of the breaker rolls on the breaker table to determine the result. d4 Result 1 The attacker breaks free from the blade\u2019s grip and suffers no effects. 2 Both the wielder of the breaker blade and their attacker become Restrained. 3 The attacker\u2019s weapon is ripped from their grasp and thrown 10 feet in a random direction. 4 The attacker\u2019s weapon, if unenchanted and nonmagical, becomes Broken. Net Use: 1 Action Range: 10 feet Bulk: 1 Hempen rope knitted together into a loose pattern. Nets cannot cause damage, but can be used to grapple and entangle creatures. The wielder of a net can throw their net in an attempt to entangle a creature. The wielder of the net makes an attack roll against an enemy. On a hit, the target becomes Encumbered. On a critical hit, the target becomes Restrained. The target can spend 2 Actions to escape from the net, ending these effects. Trident Use: 1 Action Damage: 1d6 Range: 10 feet Bulk: 2 Tridents are reach weapons that can be used to make proper strikes underwater. Attack rolls made with a trident while underwater are rolled normally, and are not rolled at disadvantage. Whip Use: 1 Action Damage: 1d6 Range: 10 feet Bulk: 1 Whips and other flexible reach weapons can deal a fearsome blow and have a chance to Restrain the target. Whenever you roll a critical hit with a whip, the targeted creature becomes Restrained. Whips are considered reach weapons for the purpose of proficiencies. Weapon Properties # Some pieces of combat gear have special properties associated with them which alter their functionality. Cursed Weaponry that has been infected by an evil force. On a hit, cursed weapons deal an additional amount of damage equal to the wielder\u2019s Will score modifier. If an Adventurer rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a cursed weapon, they become Corrupted. Gruesome Gruesome weapons are especially brutal or nefarious in their design, such as a heavy obsidian hammer or a barbed broadsword. A creature hit with a gruesome weapon must succeed a Might check against a DC of 5 or become Wounded. Holy When a holy weapon hits a creature that is innately evil, it deals an additional 1d4 damage. Honed Honed weaponry is enchanted or built to ensure a better aim or a more powerful attack. Honed weaponry grants a +1 bonus to both attack rolls made with that weapon as well as damage dealt by the weapon. Keen On a hit, keen weapons cause a creature to become Bleeding. Mythic A weapon with a legendary history. Although lesser in magnitude and power than a fable relic or a hand of Ether, a mythic weapon still has the power of stories and determination behind it. These two forces empower the mythic weapon far beyond the reaches of a typical piece of steel or shining shield. The Guide creates the abilities of a mythic weapon, and then keeps those abilities a secret until that weapon has been exalted. Until it is exalted, the item acts as a default weapon. To become exalted, the wielder of the mythic weapon must perform two tasks of the Guide\u2019s choice, such as Learn and speak the weapon\u2019s true name. Perform a heroic act with the weapon. Meditate on the weapon alone, for 1 week. Afterwards, the mythic weapon\u2019s potential is unlocked, gaining magical abilities. Poisoned The first time a creature is hit with a poisoned weapon, the target must succeed a Might check against a DC of 10 or become Sapped. The target remains Sapped until it is cured by a spell or skill. After a poisoned weapon is used to make a successful attack roll, the weapon is no longer considered poisoned. Swift Swift weapons can be used to make an attack roll as a Reaction whenever initiative is rolled, as long as the wielder already has the swift weapon drawn. This effect cannot be used if the wielder is not within the swift weapon\u2019s range of a target at the beginning of combat. Silver Silver weaponry ignores a creature's resistance to nonmagical damage.

A creature can spend 1 Action to use a blood kit in an attempt to stabilize an Unconscious creature.

Potions # Potions are consumable concoctions that can be used by Adventurers to alter their condition through the power of alchemy. Potions weigh 0 Bulk, cost 5 Coin each, and cost 1 Action to use. Once a potion is used, it is spent and cannot be used again. The vial that held the potion, however, remains in the Adventurer\u2019s possession. For the purposes of proficiency, all potions are considered ranged weapons if they are tossed at an enemy as an attack roll. Brewing Potions; Advanced Rule # Much like creating custom spells, the potions listed in the \u2018Potions\u2019 section are merely a framework of what a potion has the potential to do. At the Guide\u2019s discretion, Adventurers can brew new potions with custom effects. Potions can have any effect that the brewer wishes. The Adventurer determines the potion\u2019s effect and how it functions, and the Guide modifies and balances it accordingly. To brew a potion in this way, the Adventurer will have to collect the necessary ingredients, determined by the Guide. The recipe could call for any combination of up to three ingredients that are required to brew the concoction. The Adventurer must then journey to and collect these designated ingredients in-game. After crafting the custom potion, the Adventurer must make a Wit check against a DC of 5 to brew the tincture. On a failure, a Mechanical Mishap occurs and the potion as intended becomes useless. Acid This harmful, burning concoction can be lobbed at a target within 50 feet of the wielder. Make an attack roll. On a hit, acid deals 1d6 damage. A vial of acid can also be used to melt any nonmagical item that weighs less than 1 Bulk. Bandage With the help of a bandage, a creature can use 1 Action to apply a wrap around an injury. Using a bandage on a creature in this manner cures the Bleeding condition on that creature. Goop A thick, adhesive material that can be lobbed at a target within 50 feet of the wielder.

The box straps onto the back of a creature and has a rubberized tube that connects to a flexible and comfortable face mask. This device is most often used by those exploring flooded caverns or rooms filled with toxic gases. Backpack A canvas bag used to hold supplies. The backpack holds 10 Bulk within it. While worn, the Bulk of both the backpack itself as well as the Bulk carried within the backpack do not count against the wearer\u2019s maximum Bulk limit.

All Wit checks made in an attempt to navigate are rolled with advantage while the navigator is holding a compass.

They could be used to power an automaton, mining machine, or even a simple clock. Flask A brass container that can hold up to 3 doses of a single type of liquid. Hand Lens Used primarily by investigators, these ornate lenses magnify a user\u2019s visual acuity, granting advantage whenever they make a Wit check in an attempt to investigate an item, creature, or area. Incense A stick of scented powder that can be burned to assist in a number of ways. If a Mage casts a spell as a ritual while incense is burning within 100 feet of them, an Arcane Anomaly cannot occur. In addition, incense can be burned to turn away undead creatures. A single stick of incense burns for 10 minutes before it goes out and becomes Broken. Light Source Torches, lanterns, and candles shed light in a 10 foot radius area around its wielder, assisting Adventurers in darkened areas. Pickaxe These wood and iron tools can be used to dig into stone, exposing valuable minerals or escaping a collapsed mine. It costs 2 Stamina to dig for an hour with this tool. After an Adventurer uses this item to dig into natural stone for 1 hour, roll 1d6 to determine what they unearth. d6 Finding 1 Bedrock: A strong blow on a layer of stronger underlying stone breaks the pickaxe. 2 We\u2019ve Dug Too Deep: A chasm is exposed by your digging, and a tunneling creature awaits within, eager for the digger\u2019s flesh. 3 An Unclear Enemy: An underground gas seeps through the cracks you\u2019ve made in the stone.

Telescope A complex brass-lined lens which a creature can peer through to observe their surroundings within a 3 mile radius. Instrument Harps, lutes, drums, and other such musical instruments are rare and valuable, but can go a long way for the morale of an adventuring party. If played during a Rest, each character who can hear the instrument gains 2 Sanity points from their Rest instead of the default of 1. Glider A gnome-made harness that has a set of leathery wings within it. The glider can be used to glide through the air. If a creature falls while wearing a glider, they can spend 1 Action to activate it and reduce their fall damage a number of points equal to their 1d6 + their Agility score modifier. Rod These enchanted wands hold 1d6 charges of a certain spell. If a spell is conjoined with a rod through enchantment and the rod is blank before the enchanting, the spell can be cast 1d6 times from the rod even though the rod has been enchanted with a single spell. After the rod\u2019s charges of the spell it contains are used, the rod becomes a blank rod again. Using a rod to cast a spell it is enchanted with requires no Mana, and only costs 1 Action, regardless of the Action cost or Mana cost of the spell which the rod holds. Orb Polished crystal spheres that can be enchanted to hold a single spell. It costs a creature 1 Action to activate an orb, releasing the enchantment it holds. The spell which the orb holds is immediately cast as a result, no matter the casting time of the particular spell enchanted within the orb. Scroll Used primarily to transfer enchantments, scrolls can hold the magic of a single spell but cannot be used to cast the spell it holds. Scrolls can either be blank or contain a single spell.

A blade sharpened by a whetstone gains the honed weapon property until its wielder\u2019s next Rest. Wonder Wand This ivory rod is encrusted with raw teal crystals. You can spend 1 Action to activate it and cause an Arcane Anomaly. Custom Magical Items # The Guide is free to create their own magical items and artifacts to reward their Adventurers with. There are no particular rules for creating magical items, but caution is suggested when creating such an item and granting the Adventurer\u2019s access to it. Magic items can sometimes be so overwhelming in their power that the challenges within the game begin to become joyless. Common sense and forethought is the Guide\u2019s most valuable asset when thinking up new magical items. The simplest and most mechanically balanced way to create a magical item is to think of a nonmagical item and combine that item with a certain skill or spell as its effect. Skills and spells by themselves are not overtly powerful, and gaining a new skill through the possession of an arcane item can be a great reward for an Adventurer. A magic dagger used by a Warrior, for instance, could be infused with the Witch skill \u2018Crimson Rite\u2019, allowing the Warrior to receive visions about the enemies they slay using the dagger. Relics # Forgotten artifacts of the ancient heroes, the Relics are the most valuable reward an Adventurer could hope to obtain. Relics are magical items which cannot become Broken and can never be unenchanted or otherwise manipulated by any known force or entity, save for the greatest of deities. They are treasures of immeasurable power and potential. Each of the Relic\u2019s exact effects should be determined by the Guide using their best judgment and interpretation of the Relic\u2019s descriptions. Adventurers who are level 8 or lower must make a Will check against a DC of 5 whenever they touch a Relic for the first time. On a success, that Adventurer gains the Relic. On a failure, the Relic rejects the Adventurer. The Adventurer dies forever, cannot be resurrected. They become lost and ever adrift amidst the Ether. Agonmaul A tall ivory warhammer with a thin shaft and an ornate hammerhead. The wielder of Agonmaul adds their level as a bonus to all attack rolls they make with it. The Agonmaul can strike any nonmagical item, item, or structure and cause that target to become Broken. The Agonmaul can be wielded as if it were a heavy melee weapon, a light melee weapon, or a ranged weapon. Whenever the Agonmaul is used as a ranged weapon, it automatically returns to its owner\u2019s hand after it is thrown. The Agonmaul can only be lifted by its current owner. The Agonmaul cannot be moved by darkness. Autumn Arbiter A crossbow made up of woven golden threads, onyx, and dark wood. The stock of the crossbow is emblazoned with a golden sigil in the shape of a maple leaf. All attack rolls made with the Arbiter gain a bonus of its wielder\u2019s level. The Arbiter is a device of immense divine power. The Arbiter causes ripples in the ether whenever its bolts move through the air. Chalice of Aurum A golden chalice filled with vibrant swirls of Ether, prismatic in coloration. The face of the Chalice depicts both Elpo, the mother goddess, as well as her children, the Seven Sublime, in exquisitely detailed etchings. Those that drink from the Chalice must succeed a Will check against a DC of 18. On a failure, both the drinker and the Chalice are teleported to differing locations of the Guide\u2019s choice. The drinker then becomes permanently Corrupted as a result of their soul and body being unfit to withstand the Chalice\u2019s power. On a success, the drinker becomes a minor god. Dawn Disc The Disc is a golden maul which can blossom outwards into a perfectly circular and completely invincible shield. The Disc can be wielded as either a heavy melee weapon or a shield. It can change forms between these two options as a Free Action. While in its shield form, the Disc\u2019s Defense bonus is equal to 5. The Disc can cast the Beam spell once per Rest. The Disc sheds the sun\u2019s holy light no matter how dark its surroundings truly are. Its light is infectious, and encroaches into every emptiness around it, even those unknown to mortal kind. Gravezeal A massive, looming scythe of black wood and dead metal. Gravezeal is considered a reach weapon, and has a melee attack range of 15 feet. On a hit, the target must roll 1d6. On a roll of 1, the target dies forever and becomes a corpse companion to the wielder of Gravezeal. Gravezeal can cut through life itself, and can shape already living things into undead shadows of their former selves. Luna Wand The Luna Wand is sometimes called the Bastard Wand. The Luna Wand is a shard of sheared titan bone with black roots twisted around it. The Luna Wand increases its wielder\u2019s spell DC by 5, to a maximum of 20. Once per Rest, the Luna Wand can cast any spell of its wielder\u2019s choice once per Rest. The wand is cursed. Whenever the wand is used to cast a spell, the wielder must make a Will check against a DC of 5. On a failure, the wielder becomes Corrupted. The Luna Wand has the soul of the Frost Witch trapped within it, and it will take advantage of any opportunity to betray insufferable mortals who dare grasp its knotted shaft.

If the wearer of Maelgwyn takes damage, they regain 1d6 Health as a Reaction. If the wearer of Maelgwyn becomes Wounded, the Wounded condition ends for them during their next Rest. A creature wearing Maelgwyn can cast the spell Brambles once per Rest. Maelgwyn is the heart of all plantlife. Maelgwyn thinks and feels, and has the impulse to become unified with its wearer. Maelgwyn prefers to travel. Most importantly, Maelgwyn is most powerful when it has room to grow, such as when it is far away from other forms of plant life. Mirthmythron Mirthmythron harbors a fragment of Ether stolen from each and every artist and performer who has ever lived or ever will live. Mirthmythron is a silver lute with thirteen strings made of golden threading. Instead of a lute, the Relic can sometimes manifest as a harp made of the same materials. The wielder of Mirthmythron gains 3d10 inspire die, and can grant them in accordance within the rules of the Inspire ability, even if the wielder is not a Bard. Mirthmythron breathes deeply at night, and its melodies are purest under the moonlight. Netherfeng A dark, wavy dagger sharp enough to cut a shadow from the ground. Netherfeng has three tendrils of ghostly grey fabric which drip from its handle. The threads move through the air like smoke. The wielder of Netherfeng gains a bonus equal to their Agility score modifier to all attack rolls they make with the Relic. Netherfeng can be used as a light melee weapon or a ranged weapon. Whenever Netherfeng is used as a ranged weapon, the wielder can choose to either teleport to wherever the Relic lands as a Reaction or to have the Relic teleport back into their grasp as a Free Action. The wielder can also choose to create thick gray clouds of fog around themselves and the dagger in a 10 foot radius area whenever they hit an enemy with the Relic. Netherfeng has an eye in its hilt, but it will only open it when there is something worth looking at. Netherfeng has trickery forged into its blade. Nidhogg A pastel colored rapier with a prismatic hilt. The blade does not have, and has no need for, a guard. Nidhogg is considered a reach weapon. The wielder of Nidhogg adds their level as a bonus to all attack rolls they make with this Relic. On a hit, the target becomes pierced by light of every color, and feels deep remorse for any evil deeds they have committed. Nidhogg can bend and move around corners, and is especially deadly when wielded by a creature who has lost everything. Old Wrath Wrath is an ivory revolver made of ancient wood from the darkest forest. Wrath is a revolver with a misfire rate of 1 and an ammunition capacity of 4. Wrath does not become Broken from a misfire. Instead, if the wielder of Wrath misfires while using it, they become Corrupted. On a critical hit made with Wrath, the target becomes Wounded. The Sword Only a true hero can touch The Sword\u2019s hilt. The blade is not as discriminating. The Sword has a +5 bonus to all attack rolls made with it, and is considered a magical light melee weapon. On a hit, the target automatically becomes affected by the Etheric Ray spell. Once per Rest, the wielder can spend 1 Action to cast 1 Cleric or Witch spell of their choice by holding the Sword towards the heavens. Legends say that the Sword is sharp enough to cut a shadow from the ground. Hands of Ether # The Hands of Ether are the most pure of the Relics. Some dedicate their lives to obtain a Hand, making great sacrifices to wield their power. Some Hands find their way to worthy heroes in times of great need. The first Hands were given to the mortals by Elpo, the mother goddess, to ensure her creation\u2019s protection from her treacherous brother\u2019s malicious war on creation. Other Hands, given by lesser gods or created by enterprising mortals of great power, soon found their ways into the hearts of ancient forest tombs and forgotten halls in the bowels of other realms. To gain a Hand, an Adventurer must cut off their own hand. These are the Hands of Ether, wielded only by those at the pinnacle of fate. Cobalt Claw The sapphire hand was gifted to the primordial small folk, and the beast folk, their cousins. It was wielded by the first dwarves, gnomes, and halflings. It is the Hand of hiding, retribution, and shadows. The wielder of this Hand gains the Cunning Strike ability, regardless of their class. The wielder can spend 1 Action to move and shape up to 5 Bulk of natural stone or earth in any manner they choose. The wielder of this hand gains the spells Invisibility, Traceless, Earth Pillar, Quake, Heat Metal, Molten Eruption, and Shatter. The wielder can cast each of these spells once per Rest.

The wielder can cast each of these spells once per Rest for no Mana cost. Woven Hand The wooden hand, old and knotted, is ever-moving with roots and bark. This was the Hand bestowed to the men and elves of the jungle in the ancient age. The wielder of this hand gains the Weave ability, which they can use three times per Rest. They gain the Ether Bender skill, regardless of their level. Lastly, the wielder can spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to cause an Arcane Anomaly to occur. Pale Hand Banished to the deepest trenches of the Ether during the Pale War, the hand of the unborn god of anticreation and nullification is a malevolent instrument of undoing and chaotic corruption. Its gaunt ivory form causes horror to all who see it. When first attached to a new wielder, that wielder must succeed a Will check against a DC of 10 or have their soul lost forever. The wielder\u2019s soul is lost, and that Adventurer becomes consumed by the Hand\u2019s corruption. The lost Adventurer falls under the Guide\u2019s control. If the wielder succeeds their Will check, they gain the Pale Hand. The wielder can spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to cause a creature within 500 feet to become Corrupted. The wielder gains the Hex ability, regardless of their class. The wielder gains the spells Black Crown, Vex, Pale Blade, Wither, and Bane. The wielder can cast each of these spells once per Rest for no Mana cost. The wielder of this hand can always spend Stamina as if it were Mana, or spend Mana as if it were Stamina. Lastly, once per Rest, the wielder of the Pale Hand can point at a creature within 100 feet of it in an attempt to sever that creature\u2019s Etheric thread. The target must make a Will check against a DC of 10 or die instantly. If the target dies as a result of this effect, they cannot be resurrected, and their soul is shattered and lost.","title":"Items"},{"location":"items/#items","text":"Adventurers rely heavily on their gear and equipment to carry them through challenging endeavors. Some Adventurers rely on these items more than others, such as a Warrior\u2019s weaponry. Others are able to create and fabricate items to aid themselves and their companions. Adventurers must have a proficiency in a type of weaponry or form of protection in order to be able to use them. A proficiency in magic is not required to use items that are enchanted. Enchanted weapons, shields, and armor can be used by any Adventurer as long as they are proficient in that form of weaponry or protection. Most items cost 1 Action to use. The exceptions to this rule is armor, which is automatically and passively used if it is being worn, and ranged weaponry, which requires 1 Action to reload before being used to attack again.","title":"Items"},{"location":"items/#combat-gear","text":"Shield Use: 1 Action Defense Bonus: +2 Bulk: 1 Target, crested, buckler, tower; shields come in many shapes, sizes, and design.

Like all ranged weapons, firearms take 1 Action to reload. Some firearms, however, hold more ammunition at a time than typical ranged weapons. Firearms with larger ammunition capacities still take 1 Action to reload, but do not have to be reloaded until they have been completely depleted of ammunition. Due to these weapons not being completely perfected, they are often prone to malfunctions. Each firearm has a unique property called a \u201cmisfire rate\u201d. Whenever a wielder of a firearm rolls a natural roll result of a firearm\u2019s misfire or lower on their attack roll, the firearm becomes Broken.

Cursed Weaponry that has been infected by an evil force. On a hit, cursed weapons deal an additional amount of damage equal to the wielder\u2019s Will score modifier. If an Adventurer rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a cursed weapon, they become Corrupted. Gruesome Gruesome weapons are especially brutal or nefarious in their design, such as a heavy obsidian hammer or a barbed broadsword. A creature hit with a gruesome weapon must succeed a Might check against a DC of 5 or become Wounded. Holy When a holy weapon hits a creature that is innately evil, it deals an additional 1d4 damage. Honed Honed weaponry is enchanted or built to ensure a better aim or a more powerful attack. Honed weaponry grants a +1 bonus to both attack rolls made with that weapon as well as damage dealt by the weapon. Keen On a hit, keen weapons cause a creature to become Bleeding. Mythic A weapon with a legendary history. Although lesser in magnitude and power than a fable relic or a hand of Ether, a mythic weapon still has the power of stories and determination behind it. These two forces empower the mythic weapon far beyond the reaches of a typical piece of steel or shining shield. The Guide creates the abilities of a mythic weapon, and then keeps those abilities a secret until that weapon has been exalted. Until it is exalted, the item acts as a default weapon. To become exalted, the wielder of the mythic weapon must perform two tasks of the Guide\u2019s choice, such as Learn and speak the weapon\u2019s true name. Perform a heroic act with the weapon. Meditate on the weapon alone, for 1 week. Afterwards, the mythic weapon\u2019s potential is unlocked, gaining magical abilities. Poisoned The first time a creature is hit with a poisoned weapon, the target must succeed a Might check against a DC of 10 or become Sapped. The target remains Sapped until it is cured by a spell or skill. After a poisoned weapon is used to make a successful attack roll, the weapon is no longer considered poisoned. Swift Swift weapons can be used to make an attack roll as a Reaction whenever initiative is rolled, as long as the wielder already has the swift weapon drawn. This effect cannot be used if the wielder is not within the swift weapon\u2019s range of a target at the beginning of combat.

The Adventurer determines the potion\u2019s effect and how it functions, and the Guide modifies and balances it accordingly. To brew a potion in this way, the Adventurer will have to collect the necessary ingredients, determined by the Guide. The recipe could call for any combination of up to three ingredients that are required to brew the concoction. The Adventurer must then journey to and collect these designated ingredients in-game.

Using a rod to cast a spell it is enchanted with requires no Mana, and only costs 1 Action, regardless of the Action cost or Mana cost of the spell which the rod holds. Orb Polished crystal spheres that can be enchanted to hold a single spell. It costs a creature 1 Action to activate an orb, releasing the enchantment it holds. The spell which the orb holds is immediately cast as a result, no matter the casting time of the particular spell enchanted within the orb.

Common sense and forethought is the Guide\u2019s most valuable asset when thinking up new magical items. The simplest and most mechanically balanced way to create a magical item is to think of a nonmagical item and combine that item with a certain skill or spell as its effect. Skills and spells by themselves are not overtly powerful, and gaining a new skill through the possession of an arcane item can be a great reward for an Adventurer.

Netherfeng has three tendrils of ghostly grey fabric which drip from its handle. The threads move through the air like smoke. The wielder of Netherfeng gains a bonus equal to their Agility score modifier to all attack rolls they make with the Relic. Netherfeng can be used as a light melee weapon or a ranged weapon.

The Sword has a +5 bonus to all attack rolls made with it, and is considered a magical light melee weapon. On a hit, the target automatically becomes affected by the Etheric Ray spell. Once per Rest, the wielder can spend 1 Action to cast 1 Cleric or Witch spell of their choice by holding the Sword towards the heavens. Legends say that the Sword is sharp enough to cut a shadow from the ground.","title":"Relics"},{"location":"items/#hands-of-ether","text":"The Hands of Ether are the most pure of the Relics. Some dedicate their lives to obtain a Hand, making great sacrifices to wield their power. Some Hands find their way to worthy heroes in times of great need. The first Hands were given to the mortals by Elpo, the mother goddess, to ensure her creation\u2019s protection from her treacherous brother\u2019s malicious war on creation. Other Hands, given by lesser gods or created by enterprising mortals of great power, soon found their ways into the hearts of ancient forest tombs and forgotten halls in the bowels of other realms. To gain a Hand, an Adventurer must cut off their own hand. These are the Hands of Ether, wielded only by those at the pinnacle of fate. Cobalt Claw The sapphire hand was gifted to the primordial small folk, and the beast folk, their cousins. It was wielded by the first dwarves, gnomes, and halflings. It is the Hand of hiding, retribution, and shadows. The wielder of this Hand gains the Cunning Strike ability, regardless of their class. The wielder can spend 1 Action to move and shape up to 5 Bulk of natural stone or earth in any manner they choose. The wielder of this hand gains the spells Invisibility, Traceless, Earth Pillar, Quake, Heat Metal, Molten Eruption, and Shatter. The wielder can cast each of these spells once per Rest. Lastly, the wielder of this hand can spend 2 Stamina to become Invisible for up to 1 hour as a Free Action. Ruby Gauntlet The crimson crystal hand first belonged to the primordial scaled folk.

The wielder\u2019s damage for this ability becomes 1d10. The wielder gains the Maim skill, and gains the spells Crystallize, shield, Nautilus, Sacrifice, and Heal. The wielder can cast each of these spells once per Rest for no Mana cost. Woven Hand The wooden hand, old and knotted, is ever-moving with roots and bark. This was the Hand bestowed to the men and elves of the jungle in the ancient age. The wielder of this hand gains the Weave ability, which they can use three times per Rest. They gain the Ether Bender skill, regardless of their level. Lastly, the wielder can spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to cause an Arcane Anomaly to occur. Pale Hand Banished to the deepest trenches of the Ether during the Pale War, the hand of the unborn god of anticreation and nullification is a malevolent instrument of undoing and chaotic corruption. Its gaunt ivory form causes horror to all who see it. When first attached to a new wielder, that wielder must succeed a Will check against a DC of 10 or have their soul lost forever. The wielder\u2019s soul is lost, and that Adventurer becomes consumed by the Hand\u2019s corruption. The lost Adventurer falls under the Guide\u2019s control. If the wielder succeeds their Will check, they gain the Pale Hand. The wielder can spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to cause a creature within 500 feet to become Corrupted. The wielder gains the Hex ability, regardless of their class. The wielder gains the spells Black Crown, Vex, Pale Blade, Wither, and Bane. The wielder can cast each of these spells once per Rest for no Mana cost. The wielder of this hand can always spend Stamina as if it were Mana, or spend Mana as if it were Stamina. Lastly, once per Rest, the wielder of the Pale Hand can point at a creature within 100 feet of it in an attempt to sever that creature\u2019s Etheric thread.

If the target dies as a result of this effect, they cannot be resurrected, and their soul is shattered and lost.","title":"Hands of Ether"},{"location":"magic/","text":"Magic # Some Adventurers rely on sword and shield, their quick wits, or their training to overcome challenges. Some, however, use the powerful forces of magic to succeed in their endeavors. Whether it is traversing a dangerous crypt or fending off does, magic is a rare but powerful tool in the Adventurer\u2019s arsenal. Most Adventurers will encounter magical devices on their travels. Adventurers must be proficient in Artifacts to use them without suffering from an untrained penalty. The exception to this rule is the use of enchanted combat gear, which can be used by any Adventurer who is proficient in that type of weapon, armor, or shield. Other Adventurers have the ability to wield magic itself. If an Adventurer is a caster, there are a number of rules that apply to them. Firstly, a spell known by a caster can only be cast if the caster currently possesses the Mana required to cast that spell. The caster must also have at least one hand free and unoccupied in order to cast any spells. Lastly, some spells require special components in order to cast. Spells that require such components will describe the exact requirements needed in order to cast them. Casting Terminology # pells sometimes have a few terms within their descriptions that are used to describe certain properties and limitations of the magic that is being cast. The casting time of a spell is how many Actions the caster must spend before the effects of that spell occur. Some spells cost a caster more Actions than they possess per round. If a caster begins casting such a spell, they may continue their casting process on their subsequent turns until that spell\u2019s required amount of Actions are spent by the caster. The effects of the spell then occur. All casters can do this by default unless a caster\u2019s casting process is interrupted. For instance, if a spell requires 3 Actions to cast and the caster only has 2 Actions per round, that caster\u2019s spell will activate on their 3rd Action spent casting that spell during their next subsequent turn during the following round. If a caster is casting a spell and decides to use their 3rd Action to open a door instead of completing their casting process, their spell fails and the casting process must be restarted to activate that spell\u2019s effects. By default, a caster\u2019s spell can only ever be interrupted in three different ways; if the caster becomes Stunned, becomes Unconscious, or they choose to interrupt their own casting to perform a different activity. Certain skills and abilities can also halt caster\u2019s casting. Mana cost is how much Mana is required by the caster to spend in order to cast a spell. If a spell fails or is interrupted before it can be successfully cast, no Mana is spent or lost. A caster\u2019s Mana is only ever spent whenever a spell\u2019s effects occur.The duration of a spell is how long a spell\u2019s effects last. If the spell\u2019s duration is instant, that spell\u2019s effects happen immediately but do not continue unless otherwise stated or implied within the spell\u2019s description. Otherwise, all of a spell\u2019s listed effects end whenever the duration ends unless otherwise stated. If a spell\u2019s duration is forever, the effects of that spell are permanent by default. Range is the distance at which a spell can designate, affect, or hit a target. By default, a spell\u2019s point of origin is its caster\u2019s current position. Some spells, such as Fume, allow the caster to designate a point of origin for their spell within that spell\u2019s range. If a target is outside of a spell\u2019s range, it cannot be targeted or affected by that spell. Spell Effects on Ability Scores # Sometimes, certain spells may hinder or cripple a creature\u2019s ability scores or minor scores. If such an event occurs, scores that are decreased or altered do not affect other scores that they are related to. For example, a spell that would reduce a target\u2019s Agility score would not reduce a target\u2019s Defense. This rule is true for both ability scores and minor scores; spells that would reduce a target\u2019s Defense would not reduce that target\u2019s Agility score, either. If a spell effect grants a creature a bonus to a score, such spell effects are always added together. For instance, if a Mage and a Cleric both separately cast spells that grant a +1 bonus to the Defense of a creature, that creature gains a +2 bonus to Defense until one of either spells casted has ended. In other words, spell effects always stack. Creating New Spells # By no means should a caster\u2019s magical potential or power be limited to the spells within this manual. The spells listed in the default spell lists are merely a suggestive guideline for the ways magic could be utilized in Hands of Ether. Magic is both powerful and malleable. A caster should be able to use magic to produce any effect within reason. If an Adventurer wishes to gain a spell or cantrip that is of their own design, they should discuss their idea with their Guide outside of gameplay to determine the parameters and rules of this new spell. It is the responsibility of the Guide to compromise with the player\u2019s spell idea and to balance its powers and effects accordingly. Narratively, a newly created spell should fall under the same form of magic as an Adventurer\u2019s class. For instance, if the Adventurer is a Cleric, their spells should be based around healing or bolstering either their allies or themselves. If the Adventurer is a Witch, their spell should be themed around either hindering their enemies or manipulating the harmful elements of nature. Like all spells, your newly created spell must have a casting time, a mana cost, a duration, and a range. Cooperate with your Guide in order to determine what these spell properties should be, as well as what the spell\u2019s effects are and how it accomplishes them. Choosing New Spells # When choosing a new spell for your Adventurer to gain, be considerate of that spell\u2019s Mana cost. As you can choose to gain any spell from your class\u2019s spell list, it is possible to gain spells which you cannot cast due to your maximum Mana being too low. Some skills allow an Adventurer to gain additional spells. Such skills can vary greatly in their limitations and specifications. Most importantly, Adventurers can gain new spells through skills past their maximum amount of known spells. Adventurers who are not casters can take a number of skills that grant them spells, as well. More often than not, these particular skills allow an Adventurer to cast certain spells once per Rest. A Note on Cantrips # Any mentions of using or gaining spells within a skill\u2019s description should be assumed to include the use or gaining of cantrips as well. Cantrips are considered spells, despite costing an Adventurer no Mana. If a skill describes the casting or use of a spell, the same rules described also include the casting or use of cantrips. An Adventurer, for instance, may gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls made with spells. If that Adventurer were to cast a cantrip which calls for an attack roll, they would also apply this +2 bonus to that cantrip\u2019s attack roll.","title":"Magic"},{"location":"magic/#magic","text":"Some Adventurers rely on sword and shield, their quick wits, or their training to overcome challenges. Some, however, use the powerful forces of magic to succeed in their endeavors. Whether it is traversing a dangerous crypt or fending off does, magic is a rare but powerful tool in the Adventurer\u2019s arsenal. Most Adventurers will encounter magical devices on their travels. Adventurers must be proficient in Artifacts to use them without suffering from an untrained penalty. The exception to this rule is the use of enchanted combat gear, which can be used by any Adventurer who is proficient in that type of weapon, armor, or shield. Other Adventurers have the ability to wield magic itself. If an Adventurer is a caster, there are a number of rules that apply to them. Firstly, a spell known by a caster can only be cast if the caster currently possesses the Mana required to cast that spell. The caster must also have at least one hand free and unoccupied in order to cast any spells. Lastly, some spells require special components in order to cast. Spells that require such components will describe the exact requirements needed in order to cast them.","title":"Magic"},{"location":"magic/#casting-terminology","text":"pells sometimes have a few terms within their descriptions that are used to describe certain properties and limitations of the magic that is being cast. The casting time of a spell is how many Actions the caster must spend before the effects of that spell occur. Some spells cost a caster more Actions than they possess per round. If a caster begins casting such a spell, they may continue their casting process on their subsequent turns until that spell\u2019s required amount of Actions are spent by the caster. The effects of the spell then occur. All casters can do this by default unless a caster\u2019s casting process is interrupted. For instance, if a spell requires 3 Actions to cast and the caster only has 2 Actions per round, that caster\u2019s spell will activate on their 3rd Action spent casting that spell during their next subsequent turn during the following round. If a caster is casting a spell and decides to use their 3rd Action to open a door instead of completing their casting process, their spell fails and the casting process must be restarted to activate that spell\u2019s effects. By default, a caster\u2019s spell can only ever be interrupted in three different ways; if the caster becomes Stunned, becomes Unconscious, or they choose to interrupt their own casting to perform a different activity. Certain skills and abilities can also halt caster\u2019s casting. Mana cost is how much Mana is required by the caster to spend in order to cast a spell. If a spell fails or is interrupted before it can be successfully cast, no Mana is spent or lost. A caster\u2019s Mana is only ever spent whenever a spell\u2019s effects occur.The duration of a spell is how long a spell\u2019s effects last. If the spell\u2019s duration is instant, that spell\u2019s effects happen immediately but do not continue unless otherwise stated or implied within the spell\u2019s description. Otherwise, all of a spell\u2019s listed effects end whenever the duration ends unless otherwise stated. If a spell\u2019s duration is forever, the effects of that spell are permanent by default. Range is the distance at which a spell can designate, affect, or hit a target. By default, a spell\u2019s point of origin is its caster\u2019s current position. Some spells, such as Fume, allow the caster to designate a point of origin for their spell within that spell\u2019s range. If a target is outside of a spell\u2019s range, it cannot be targeted or affected by that spell.","title":"Casting Terminology"},{"location":"magic/#spell-effects-on-ability-scores","text":"Sometimes, certain spells may hinder or cripple a creature\u2019s ability scores or minor scores. If such an event occurs, scores that are decreased or altered do not affect other scores that they are related to. For example, a spell that would reduce a target\u2019s Agility score would not reduce a target\u2019s Defense. This rule is true for both ability scores and minor scores; spells that would reduce a target\u2019s Defense would not reduce that target\u2019s Agility score, either. If a spell effect grants a creature a bonus to a score, such spell effects are always added together. For instance, if a Mage and a Cleric both separately cast spells that grant a +1 bonus to the Defense of a creature, that creature gains a +2 bonus to Defense until one of either spells casted has ended. In other words, spell effects always stack.","title":"Spell Effects on Ability Scores"},{"location":"magic/#creating-new-spells","text":"By no means should a caster\u2019s magical potential or power be limited to the spells within this manual.

A caster should be able to use magic to produce any effect within reason. If an Adventurer wishes to gain a spell or cantrip that is of their own design, they should discuss their idea with their Guide outside of gameplay to determine the parameters and rules of this new spell.

Typically, these skill sets are naturally adopted by them as a result of their background or lifestyle. Some Adventurers lived early lives of desperation, surviving as urchins and thieves to gain the skills of the Rogue. Others may have heard a higher calling, charged with protecting innocents in the name of the gods that fuel their magic; these Adventurers became Clerics. Classes are a framework of rules and abilities that help to determine how your Adventurer functions. Are they spell casters who rely on magical tricks to shield them from danger? Do they rely on their training as a former city guard, knowing that the use of a sword and shield is the best method to solve problems? There are ten core classes in Hands of Ether. Each class has its own list of skills to choose from. You can choose skills from either your class skill list or the general skill list. You can choose these skills in any order you wish throughout the course of your adventure. These skills determine exactly who your Adventurer is and what they are capable of, so choose wisely. Most importantly, each class has a primary ability. The primary ability an Adventurer possesses is the most important part of their class, as it determines what that Adventurer\u2019s role is in an adventuring party. If you wish to be more supportive and selfless to your adventuring companions, the Sage\u2019s Discern ability can reveal the weaknesses of foes and other hints to overcoming challenges that your party faces.

Typically, these skill sets are naturally adopted by them as a result of their background or lifestyle. Some Adventurers lived early lives of desperation, surviving as urchins and thieves to gain the skills of the Rogue. Others may have heard a higher calling, charged with protecting innocents in the name of the gods that fuel their magic; these Adventurers became Clerics. Classes are a framework of rules and abilities that help to determine how your Adventurer functions. Are they spell casters who rely on magical tricks to shield them from danger? Do they rely on their training as a former city guard, knowing that the use of a sword and shield is the best method to solve problems? There are ten core classes in Hands of Ether. Each class has its own list of skills to choose from. You can choose skills from either your class skill list or the general skill list. You can choose these skills in any order you wish throughout the course of your adventure. These skills determine exactly who your Adventurer is and what they are capable of, so choose wisely. Most importantly, each class has a primary ability. The primary ability an Adventurer possesses is the most important part of their class, as it determines what that Adventurer\u2019s role is in an adventuring party. If you wish to be more supportive and selfless to your adventuring companions, the Sage\u2019s Discern ability can reveal the weaknesses of foes and other hints to overcoming challenges that your party faces.
