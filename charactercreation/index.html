<h1 id="character-creation">Character Creation<a class="headerlink" href="#character-creation" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Each player in the game other than the Guide creates an Adventurer that they embody and control. This character is used as a tool by the player to experience the world and story - a portal and proxy to the adventure.  </p>
<p>An Adventurer’s capabilities and identity is determined by their player’s choice of class, lineage, skills, spells, and ability scores. Each player determines the aspects of their Adventurer, such as their name, appearance, species, personality, and history. Each Adventurer also has a class, which is a set of talents and techniques they use as a tool to overcome challenges during the adventure. Each class has a primary ability and its own unique list of skills and spells to choose from.  </p>
<p>Beyond your Adventurer’s scores and abilities, it is just as important to breath life into your Adventurer as a person. Think about what sort of goals, intents, or tenets your Adventurer may have. Consider their early life - was it lived out under tenuous tutelage in a dim monastery, or filled with sunshiny afternoons on the family farm? Try to imagine what your Adventurer’s ambitions and desires might be.  </p>
<p>These kind of questions can guide you in choosing the right skills for your Adventurer, but can also help you to better embody them while roleplaying.  </p>
<p>Try creating an Adventurer with other players in mind, and to make an Adventurer that will benefit the story as a whole. More often than not, an Adventurer who naturally fits into the world will flourish, and be more enjoyable to play as. Have a conversation with your Guide about who your Adventurer may be, where they might have grown up, and why they would have taken up a daring life of adventure to begin with.  </p>
<p>Consider what your Adventurer wears on a daily basis - are they functional and prepared, or illustrious and fanciful? What moniker does your Adventurer go by? These details can be important in aiding the Guide while they tailor a story to suit your character. The more cohesion there is between the Guide’s world and your character, the more interesting your tale will become. The Guide will have a much easier time, and a lot more fun, creating situations and encounters tailored especially for your Adventurer. Just remember to leave gaps in your Adventurer’s life, so that the Guide can have some surprises in store for you! Creating an Adventurer is a collaborative process.</p>

<h2 id="class-and-lineage">Class and Lineage<a class="headerlink" href="#class-and-lineage" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Your Adventurer’s identity is based largely around their class and lineage. An Adventurer’s class defines what kind of techniques and talents they use to overcome challenges during their adventure. An Adventurer’s class could be that of a Warrior, who battles their enemies brazenly with sword and shield, or a Sage, who takes a more cautious, intellectual approach when overcoming adversity.  </p>
<p>An Adventurer’s lineage is their ancestry, or species, that they were born into. Besides dictating an Adventurer’s appearance to an extent, lineage also grants an Adventurer with a few skills that represent their species’ natural talents. Dwarves, for instance, can see in the dark as a natural result of their underground heritage. Each lineage also improves an Adventurer’s ability scores to differing degrees. Ogres, for instance, are naturally more brawny than other species. These ability score improvements listed under each lineage increase an Adventurer’s ability scores, not their ability score modifiers.</p>
<h2 id="ability-scores">Ability Scores<a class="headerlink" href="#ability-scores" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Each creature, including each Adventurer, has four ability scores that are used to define and describe their strengths and weaknesses in the game world. These ability scores are Agility, Might, Will, and Wit. To determine an Adventurer’s ability scores at level 1, roll 3d6 for each score and apply each separately rolled total to an ability score of your choice.  </p>
<p>Alternatively, you could use and apply the standard, predetermined scores of 14, 11, 10, and 7. If you use this standard array of scores, you can place them in whichever ability scores you so choose.  </p>
<p>If you wish to roll with less chance of low scores, you and your adventuring group could instead agree to roll 4d6 for each ability score total, discarding the lowest die from each roll of 4d6. This option is best if your players and your Guide are beginning a long-term campaign.  </p>
<p>If none of these methods suit your game’s needs, it is recommended that the player and their Guide discuss what the Adventurer’s former life was like, and what sorts of events shaped their past to determine your Adventurer’s ability scores manually.  </p>
<p>Ability scores can never be lower than 3 or higher than 18, unless magic is afoot. After rolling your ability scores, be sure to apply your lineage’s ability score improvements.  </p>
<p><strong>Agility</strong> is the attribute used to gauge a creature's dexterity, as well as how quickly and effectively they can react to their surroundings. A high score in Agility may mean the creature has quick reflexes or that their hand-eye coordination is especially well-trained. Agility is used to evade physical effects and attacks, carefully manipulate items, sneak, balance, and perform feats of dexterity.  </p>
<p><strong>Might</strong> represents a creature's constitution, strength, and physicality. A creature with a high Might could be brawny and tough, or they may have an especially high threshold of endurance against injuries or toxins. Might is used in battle to resist physical effects and to perform feats of strength.  </p>
<p><strong>Will</strong> is a creature's mental and emotional resolve, their charisma, and their ability to wield or resist magical forces. Creatures with a high Will score may be especially courageous, devoted, charming, or magical. Will is used to navigate social interactions, to resist mind-altering effects, and to channel magic.  </p>
<p><strong>Wit</strong> is a creature's general cognition, their knowledge of the world around them, and how well they utilize that knowledge. Adventurers with high Wit could be wise scholars, perceptive scouts, or cunning criminals. Wit is used to understand and apply knowledge, recall lore, perceive and understand your surroundings, and to investigate.  </p>
<p>Each of these four ability scores have a smaller number associated with them called a modifier. Modifiers are always used in conjunction with a relative ability check. They are applied to the total result of an ability check as either a bonus or a penalty.</p>

<p>Whenever your Adventurer reaches level 5, you can increase a single ability score of your choice by 3 points, or increase a number of ability scores by 3 separate points. An ability score’s modifier may increase as a result of this enhancement.</p>
<h2 id="minor-scores">Minor Scores<a class="headerlink" href="#minor-scores" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Beyond their four ability scores, each Adventurer also has a number of minor scores that represent their current condition. These minor scores are called Health, Stamina, Defense, Speed, Bulk Limit, Mortality, Mana, and Spell DC.  </p>
<p><strong>Health.</strong> Health is how much physical vitality a creature has remaining before they can no longer remain conscious. If a creature reaches 0 Health, they become Unconscious and unstabilized. An Adventurer’s maximum Health is determined by their lineage.  </p>
<p><strong>Stamina.</strong> Stamina is an Adventurer's endurance and physical energy. Strenuous activities may result in an Adventurer's Stamina being depleted. Some class abilities and skills require the spending of Stamina to use or activate. If an Adventurer's Stamina is reduced to 0, they become Exhausted. An Adventurer's maximum Stamina is equal to their Might score.  </p>
<p><strong>Defense.</strong> The score that represents how difficult it is to successfully damage a creature. A high Defense could mean a creature’s armor is sturdy and difficult to pierce, or that they are proficient at dodging attacks. Each creature and item in the game has a Defense. Attack rolls must meet or exceed a target’s Defense in order to deal any damage to that target. By default, an Adventurer's Defense is equal to their Agility score.  </p>
<p><strong>Speed.</strong> This score is how quickly a creature can move during their turn. An Adventurer's Speed is determined by their lineage, and defined by increments of 5 feet.  </p>
<p><strong>Bulk Max.</strong> This score represents how much an Adventurer can carry. If an Adventurer is carrying an amount of Bulk that exceeds their Bulk score, they become Encumbered.  </p>
<p><strong>Mortality.</strong> Mortality represents an Adventurer’s ability to cling to life while Unconscious. Each Adventurer has a maximum of 3 Mortality by default. Adventurers regain their maximum amount of Mortality each Rest. If an Adventurer reaches 0 Mortality, that Adventurer dies.  </p>
<p><strong>Mana.</strong> Mana represents the Ether within an Adventurer, and their capability to use that Ether. Mana is essentially a reflection of the amount of magical energy and potential an Adventurer possesses. Most spells require the spending of this magical energy in order to be cast. Some Adventurers do not have any Mana. If an Adventurer does have Mana, that Adventurer's maximum Mana is equal to their level multiplied by 2.  </p>
<p><strong>Spell DC.</strong> The DC for resisting or avoiding magical effects which a creature casts. An Adventurer’s spell DC is equal to their class’s primary ability score.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#skills" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Each Adventurer has a number of skills that they can use while adventuring. Each class has a list of skills to choose from. Skills are abilities, talents, or techniques that are used to perform specific activities or abilities. An Adventurer’s true talents and capabilities are determined by which skills they possess. When gaining a skill, an Adventurer can choose a skill from either the general skill list or from their class skill list.  </p>
<p>Each Adventurer begins at level 1 with 1 skill by default, as well as their lineage skills. Adventurers gain 1 new skill each time they advance in level. Once an Adventurer has gained a certain skill, they can never gain that same skill again.</p>
<h2 id="spells">Spells<a class="headerlink" href="#spells" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>If your Adventurer is a casting class, they know an amount of spells. By default, the amount of spells an Adventurer knows is equal to their level multiplied by 2. Each casting Adventurer also begins at level 1 with 1 cantrip of their choice. Cantrips are simple spells that require no Mana to cast. Each caster gains 1 additional cantrip of their choice from their class cantrip list whenever they reach level 3, level 6, and level 9. Each caster also has a spell DC, which is a minor score used to determine whether or not a target of a spell can resist or evade that spell’s effects. A caster’s spell DC is equal to their primary ability score.</p>
<h2 id="proficiencies">Proficiencies<a class="headerlink" href="#proficiencies" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Each Adventurer begins with 3 proficiencies of their choice. Proficiencies represent training with certain types of protective gear, weapons, or items. There are six distinct types of proficiencies that an Adventurer could possess. Adventurers that attempt to use an item they lack proficiency in become susceptible to that type of item’s untrained penalty; the details of which are listed below each proficiency in the following list.  </p>
<p><strong>Armor.</strong> Platemail, leather, padded suits, breastplates; any and all types of worn protective garb.<br />
<em>Untrained Penalty:</em> While armor is being worn by an Adventurer that does not have proficiency in armor, that Adventurer becomes Encumbered.  </p>
<p><strong>Melee.</strong> Swords, hammers, axes, daggers, and any other type of weapon with a 5 foot melee range.<br />
<em>Untrained Penalty:</em> Adventurers lacking proficiency with melee weapons make attack rolls with them at disadvantage.  </p>
<p><strong>Artifact.</strong> The use of magic devices, such as rods, orbs, and other arcane implements. This includes thrown potions and bombs.<br />
<em>Untrained Penalty:</em> Adventurers not proficient in the use of magic devices must roll 1d4 whenever they use an Action to activate or trigger such items. On a result of 1, an Arcane Anomaly occurs.  </p>
<p><strong>Reach.</strong> Long-reaching melee weaponry, such as glaives, whips, and spears, that have a 10 foot melee range.<br />
<em>Untrained Penalty:</em> Adventurers lacking proficiency with reach weapons make attack rolls with them at disadvantage.  </p>
<p><strong>Ranged.</strong> Bows, firearms, slings, thrown daggers, and other ranged weaponry that relies on accuracy over power.<br />
<em>Untrained Penalty:</em> Adventurers lacking proficiency with ranged weapons make attack rolls with them at disadvantage. A roll result of 1 made with a ranged weapon by an Adventurer who lacks proficiency in ranged weapons results in that Adventurer automatically hitting their closest ally.  </p>
<p><strong>Shield.</strong> Shields used to block attacks and further protect the wielder beyond the use of armor.
<em>Untrained Penalty:</em> Adventurers lacking proficiency with shields only benefit from a +1 bonus to their Defense whenever they use that shield to defend themselves, no matter the Defense bonus of that particular shield.</p>
<h2 id="languages">Languages<a class="headerlink" href="#languages" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Each Adventurer starts at level 1 knowing 2 languages of their choice. There are a total of six different languages that exist in the world of Hands of Ether.  </p>
<p><strong>Cipher.</strong> A codified language spoken by thieves, insurgents, and others that wish for their communication to remain veiled and secret. It is made up of nonsense words and secret phrases that obscure the true meaning of what is being spoken.  </p>
<p><strong>Common.</strong> The most well-known and most commonly spoken tongue. All species and cultures speak this language, having been inundated with it from a young age.  </p>
<p><strong>Deep.</strong> The language of the underground. Goblins and other dwellers of the caverns below the surface world speak this twisted tongue.  </p>
<p><strong>Green.</strong> The wild tongue. Fairy creatures, beasts, and other beings of nature speak the silky words of this elegant and whimsical language between each other.  </p>
<p><strong>High.</strong> High is a language designated for those of noble heritage or high ranks. The High language is uncommon, and mostly used to put on a show of power amongst rich merchants and bureaucrats. High speech is eloquent and luxurious, and is often used in songs and poems because of its beauty. Its origin does not lie in the house of nobles, however, but is actually the natural tongue of spirits and gods that was stolen and misused by mortals. Most mortal creatures, even those that speak the language, are unaware of its origins.  </p>
<p><strong>Primordial.</strong> A dead language, and the rarest form of spoken communication. It is spoken by ancient creatures, and can sometimes be found inscribed onto old ruins or along the blades of legendary swords.</p>
<h2 id="starting-equipment">Starting Equipment<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-equipment" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Each Adventurer begins at level 1 having a number of items already in their possession. Each Adventurer begins with:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 kit of their choice.</li>
<li>10 Coin.</li>
<li>1 set of clothing of their choice.</li>
<li>1 of each type of item which they are proficient in.</li>
</ul>
<p>An Adventurer who is proficient with shields and armor, for instance, begins with 1 shield and 1 set of armor in their possession.  </p>
<p>If the Adventurer is a caster, they also begin with a casting focus, such as a wand, staff, holy symbol, spell book, or other trinket that the caster uses to channel their magic through.  </p>
<p>If an Adventurer’s starting items include a ranged weapon, that Adventurer also begins with 2d10 pieces of ammunition made for that ranged weapon.  </p>
<p>Lastly, Adventurers proficient in artifacts must speak with their Guide to determine what sort of magical item that Adventurer begins with. An orb infused with a single minor spell is a good choice if an artifact cannot be decided on through conversation between the player and the Guide.</p>
<h2 id="leveling-up">Leveling Up<a class="headerlink" href="#leveling-up" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Through adventuring, experiencing, and overcoming challenges, Adventurers will naturally become more powerful within their respective skill set. This process is called leveling up. While Adventurers begin at level 1, they may progress up to level 10, where they are considered renowned heroes.  </p>
<p>Each time an Adventurer levels up, they gain new skills and improved abilities. The Guide determines when the party levels up. The Guide typically advances the party in level whenever they overcome an event that is particularly challenging or harrowing. It is highly recommended that each member of an adventuring party levels up at the same time in order to maintain consistency in their story as a whole.  </p>
<p>Each time an Adventurer levels up, they gain the following enhancements.  </p>
<p><strong>Health.</strong> The Adventurer’s maximum Health increases. Roll that Adventurer’s Health die, determined by their lineage’s “Health Increase at Level Up” statistic, and increase their maximum Health by an amount equal to the rolled result.  </p>
<p><strong>Skills.</strong> The Adventurer gains 1 new skill of their choice from their class skill list or the general skill list.  </p>
<p><strong>Magic.</strong> If the Adventurer is a caster, their maximum Mana increases by 2. In addition, they gain 2 new spells of their choice from their class spell list. They gain 1 new cantrip of their choice whenever they reach levels 3, 6, and 9.  </p>
<p><strong>Ability Scores.</strong> Whenever the Adventurer reaches level 5, an ability score of their choice increases by 3, to a maximum of 18. Be sure to adjust other scores and ability score modifiers if those scores would be increased or affected as a result of this ability score improvement.</p></div>
