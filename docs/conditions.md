# Conditions

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class ability, a monster’s attack, or other effects. Most conditions, such as being Blinded, are impairments. A few, however, can be advantageous. A condition lasts either until it is countered (the effects of the Unconscious condition end when the affected creature is healed, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that caused the condition.  

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or it doesn’t. The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a certain condition. The effects of conditions are not permanent by default.  

### Broken
This condition can only be gained by items and structures. Broken items cannot be used by a creature. Broken structures fall to the ground and become loose debris. By default, enchanted and magical items cannot become Broken.  

### Blinded
Blinded creatures cannot see, and make attack rolls with disadvantage.  

### Charmed
Creatures with this condition consider their charmer an ally, and cannot target them with damaging abilities, skills, spells, or attacks. The charmer makes Will checks with advantage when attempting to socially influence their Charmed target.  

### Corrupted
Creatures that have been Corrupted gain a single Corruption from the Corruption table. The effects of a Corruption last until it is cured by a spell, ability, or skill that can cure a Corruption. A creature cannot have more than 1 Corruption at the same time.  

### Covered
Creatures that are Covered gain a +3 bonus to their Defense.  

### Encumbered
An Encumbered creature’s Speed becomes 20.  

### Exhausted
Exhausted creatures make all ability checks and attack rolls with disadvantage. If a creature uses or loses 2 Stamina while they are Exhausted, they become Unconscious and Stabilized.  

### Invisible
Creatures with this condition cannot be seen. Attack rolls against Invisible creatures have disadvantage. Invisible creatures roll with advantage on all Agility checks made in an attempt to hide or sneak.  

### Prone
Prone creatures lay flat on the ground. Crawling while Prone is considered movement over Rough terrain. Attack rolls against Prone creatures have advantage if the attacker is within melee range of the creature. Otherwise, attack rolls against a Prone creature have disadvantage.  

### Restrained
A Restrained creature’s Speed becomes 0.  

### Sapped
A Sapped creature has disadvantage on all ability checks.  

### Stabilized
A Stabilized creature is Unconscious but does not roll Mortality checks.  

### Stunned
A Stunned creature cannot use any Actions or Free Actions, and their Speed becomes 0. Attack rolls made against Stunned creatures are rolled with advantage.  

### Unconscious
An Unconscious creature is Stunned, Prone, can’t move or speak, and is completely unaware of its surroundings. Unconscious creatures automatically fail all ability checks. Creatures that become Unconscious during a combat encounter make 1 Mortality check on each of its subsequent turns, beginning with its next turn after it becomes Unconscious.  

(Wounded) CreaturesthathavebeenWoundedgaina single Wound from the Wound table. The effects of a Wound last until it is cured by a spell, item, or skill that can cure a Wound. A bandage, for instance, cures a creature who is Bleeding. A creature cannot have more than 1 Wound at the same time. Some skills and spells will specify which particular Wound a creature becomes afflicted with.
