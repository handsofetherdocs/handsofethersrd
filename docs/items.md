# Items
Adventurers rely heavily on their gear and equipment to carry them through challenging endeavors. Some Adventurers rely on these items more than others, such as a Warrior’s weaponry. Others are able to create and fabricate items to aid themselves and their companions. Adventurers must have a proficiency in a type of weaponry or form of protection in order to be able to use them. A proficiency in magic is not required to use items that are enchanted. Enchanted weapons, shields, and armor can be used by any Adventurer as long as they are proficient in that form of weaponry or protection.  

Most items cost 1 Action to use. The exceptions to this rule is armor, which is automatically and passively used if it is being worn, and ranged weaponry, which requires 1 Action to reload before being used to attack again.

## Firearms
These rare ranged weapons are a technological marvel which use a combination of gunpowder, intricate metalwork, and alchemical combustion to launch shells and balls of iron at a target to devastating effects. Like all ranged weapons, firearms take 1 Action to reload. Some firearms, however, hold more ammunition at a time than typical ranged weapons. Firearms with larger ammunition capacities still take 1 Action to reload, but do not have to be reloaded until they have been completely depleted of ammunition.

Due to these weapons not being completely perfected, they are often prone to malfunctions. Each firearm has a unique property called a “misfire rate”. Whenever a wielder of a firearm rolls a natural roll result of a firearm’s misfire or lower on their attack roll, the firearm becomes Broken. If an Adventurer does not possess a skill to fix a Broken firearm, they may need to seek out a powerful artificer within the world to fix their broken weapon in exchange for Coin.

## Weapon Properties
Some pieces of combat gear have special properties associated with them which alter their functionality.
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
<div style="grid-column: 1/2; margin-right: 13px;">
**Cursed**

**Mythic**  
A weapon with a legendary history. Although lesser in magnitude and power than a fable relic or a hand of Ether, a mythic weapon still has the power of stories and determination behind it. These two forces empower the mythic weapon far beyond the reaches of a typical piece of steel or shining shield. The Guide creates the abilities of a mythic weapon, and then keeps those abilities a secret until that weapon has been exalted. Until it is exalted, the item acts as a default weapon. To become exalted, the wielder of the mythic weapon must perform two tasks of the Guide’s choice, such as Learn and speak the weapon’s true name. Perform a heroic act with the weapon. Meditate on the weapon alone, for 1 week. Afterwards, the mythic weapon’s potential is unlocked, gaining magical abilities.  

</div>
<div style="grid-column: 2/3; margin-right: 13px;">

**Poisoned**  
The first time a creature is hit with a poisoned weapon, the target must succeed a Might check against a DC of 10 or become Sapped. The target remains Sapped until it is cured by a spell or skill.

**Swift**  
Swift weapons can be used to make an attack roll as a Reaction whenever initiative is rolled, as long as the wielder already has the swift weapon drawn. This effect cannot be used if the wielder is not within the swift weapon’s range of a target at the beginning of combat.

## Potions
Potions are consumable concoctions that can be used by Adventurers to alter their condition through the power of alchemy. Potions weigh 0 Bulk, cost 5 Coin each, and cost 1 Action to use. Once a potion is used, it is spent and cannot be used again. The vial that held the potion, however, remains in the Adventurer’s possession. For the purposes of proficiency, all potions are considered ranged weapons if they are tossed at an enemy as an attack roll.  

### Brewing Potions; Advanced Rule
Much like creating custom spells, the potions listed in the ‘Potions’ section are merely a framework of what a potion has the potential to do. At the Guide’s discretion, Adventurers can brew new potions with custom effects. Potions can have any effect that the brewer wishes.  

The Adventurer determines the potion’s effect and how it functions, and the Guide modifies and balances it accordingly. To brew a potion in this way, the Adventurer will have to collect the necessary ingredients, determined by the Guide. The recipe could call for any combination of up to three ingredients that are required to brew the concoction.  

The Adventurer must then journey to and collect these designated ingredients in-game. After crafting the custom potion, the Adventurer must make a Wit check against a DC of 5 to brew the tincture. On a failure, a Mechanical Mishap occurs and the potion as intended becomes useless.  
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
<div style="grid-column: 1/2; margin-right: 13px;">
**Acid**  
This harmful, burning concoction can be lobbed at a target within 50 feet of the wielder. Make an attack roll. On a hit, acid deals 1d6 damage. A vial of acid can also be used to melt any nonmagical item that weighs less than 1 Bulk.   

**Bandage**  
With the help of a bandage, a creature can use 1 Action to apply a wrap around an injury. Using a bandage on a creature in this manner cures the Bleeding condition on that creature.   

**Goop**  
A thick, adhesive material that can be lobbed at a target within 50 feet of the wielder. On a successful attack roll, the target affected by this gelatinous substance becomes Restrained until they can succeed a Might check against a DC of 10 to escape.   

**Healing Potion**  
A thick, gelatinous brew of crimson liquid that heals the drinker for 1d6 Health.   

**Mana Potion**  
A silky cobalt tonic filled with magical energy that restores the drinker’s Mana by 1d6.   

**Poison**  
A dose of a toxic concoction that can be used to poison other creatures by putting it on food or that can be used to apply the poisoned property to a single weapon. If a creature touches or ingests poison, they must succeed a Might check against a DC of 10 or become Sapped until their next Rest.   

</div>
<div style="grid-column: 2/3; margin-right: 13px;">
**Ration**  
A tin filled with dried meat, berries, spiced bread, and rice. Creatures who consume a ration regain 1d6 Stamina.

**Flask**  
A brass container that can hold up to 3 doses of a single type of liquid.   

**Hand Lens**  
Used primarily by investigators, these ornate lenses magnify a user’s visual acuity, granting advantage whenever they make a Wit check in an attempt to investigate an item, creature, or area.   

**Incense**  
A stick of scented powder that can be burned to assist in a number of ways. If a Mage casts a spell as a ritual while incense is burning within 100 feet of them, an Arcane Anomaly cannot occur.

Torches, lanterns, and candles shed light in a 10 foot radius area around its wielder, assisting Adventurers in darkened areas.   

**Pickaxe**  
These wood and iron tools can be used to dig into stone, exposing valuable minerals or escaping a collapsed mine. It costs 2 Stamina to dig for an hour with this tool. After an Adventurer uses this item to dig into natural stone for 1 hour, roll 1d6 to determine what they unearth.

**Telescope**  
A complex brass-lined lens which a creature can peer through to observe their surroundings within a 3 mile radius.   

**Instrument**  
Harps, lutes, drums, and other such musical instruments are rare and valuable, but can go a long way for the morale of an adventuring party. If played during a Rest, each character who can hear the instrument gains 2 Sanity points from their Rest instead of the default of 1.   

**Glider**  
A gnome-made harness that has a set of leathery wings within it. The glider can be used to glide through the air. If a creature falls while wearing a glider, they can spend 1 Action to activate it and reduce their fall damage a number of points equal to their 1d6 + their Agility score modifier.   

**Rod**  
These enchanted wands hold 1d6 charges of a certain spell. If a spell is conjoined with a rod through enchantment and the rod is blank before the enchanting, the spell can be cast 1d6 times from the rod even though the rod has been enchanted with a single spell. After the rod’s charges of the spell it contains are used, the rod becomes a blank rod again. Using a rod to cast a spell it is enchanted with requires no Mana, and only costs 1 Action, regardless of the Action cost or Mana cost of the spell which the rod holds.   

**Orb**  
Polished crystal spheres that can be enchanted to hold a single spell. It costs a creature 1 Action to activate an orb, releasing the enchantment it holds. The spell which the orb holds is immediately cast as a result, no matter the casting time of the particular spell enchanted within the orb.   

**Scroll**  
Used primarily to transfer enchantments, scrolls can hold the magic of a single spell but cannot be used to cast the spell it holds. Scrolls can either be blank or contain a single spell.   

**Star Rod**  
Sometimes referred to as sun rods, these transparent glass batons shed light in a 50 foot radius area and cannot become Broken, even from great falls into cavernous chasms. They shed this light constantly, and are held in tubular holsters to carry them discreetly.

</div>
</div>

## Custom Magical Items
The Guide is free to create their own magical items and artifacts to reward their Adventurers with. There are no particular rules for creating magical items, but caution is suggested when creating such an item and granting the Adventurer’s access to it. Magic items can sometimes be so overwhelming in their power that the challenges within the game begin to become joyless. Common sense and forethought is the Guide’s most valuable asset when thinking up new magical items.  

The simplest and most mechanically balanced way to create a magical item is to think of a nonmagical item and combine that item with a certain skill or spell as its effect. Skills and spells by themselves are not overtly powerful, and gaining a new skill through the possession of an arcane item can be a great reward for an Adventurer.  

A magic dagger used by a Warrior, for instance, could be infused with the Witch skill ‘Crimson Rite’, allowing the Warrior to receive visions about the enemies they slay using the dagger.  

## Relics
Forgotten artifacts of the ancient heroes, the Relics are the most valuable reward an Adventurer could hope to obtain. Relics are magical items which cannot become Broken and can never be unenchanted or otherwise manipulated by any known force or entity, save for the greatest of deities. They are treasures of immeasurable power and potential.  

Each of the Relic’s exact effects should be determined by the Guide using their best judgment and interpretation of the Relic’s descriptions. Adventurers who are level 8 or lower must make a Will check against a DC of 5 whenever they touch a Relic for the first time. On a success, that Adventurer gains the Relic. On a failure, the Relic rejects the Adventurer. The Adventurer dies forever, cannot be resurrected. They become lost and ever adrift amidst the Ether.  
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
<div style="grid-column: 1/2; margin-right: 13px;">
**Agonmaul**  
A tall ivory warhammer with a thin shaft and an ornate hammerhead. The wielder of Agonmaul adds their level as a bonus to all attack rolls they make with it. The Agonmaul can strike any nonmagical item, item, or structure and cause that target to become Broken. The Agonmaul can be wielded as if it were a heavy melee weapon, a light melee weapon, or a ranged weapon. Whenever the Agonmaul is used as a ranged weapon, it automatically returns to its owner’s hand after it is thrown. The Agonmaul can only be lifted by its current owner. The Agonmaul cannot be moved by darkness.   

**Autumn Arbiter**  
A crossbow made up of woven golden threads, onyx, and dark wood. The stock of the crossbow is emblazoned with a golden sigil in the shape of a maple leaf. All attack rolls made with the Arbiter gain a bonus of its wielder’s level. The Arbiter is a device of immense divine power. The Arbiter causes ripples in the ether whenever its bolts move through the air.   

**Chalice of Aurum**  
A golden chalice filled with vibrant swirls of Ether, prismatic in coloration. The face of the Chalice depicts both Elpo, the mother goddess, as well as her children, the Seven Sublime, in exquisitely detailed etchings. Those that drink from the Chalice must succeed a Will check against a DC of 18. On a failure, both the drinker and the Chalice are teleported to differing locations of the Guide’s choice. The drinker then becomes permanently Corrupted as a result of their soul and body being unfit to withstand the Chalice’s power. On a success, the drinker becomes a minor god.   

**Dawn Disc**  
The Disc is a golden maul which can blossom outwards into a perfectly circular and completely invincible shield. The Disc can be wielded as either a heavy melee weapon or a shield. It can change forms between these two options as a Free Action. While in its shield form, the Disc’s Defense bonus is equal to 5. The Disc can cast the Beam spell once per Rest. The Disc sheds the sun’s holy light no matter how dark its surroundings truly are. Its light is infectious, and encroaches into every emptiness around it, even those unknown to mortal kind.   

**Gravezeal**  
A massive, looming scythe of black wood and dead metal. Gravezeal is considered a reach weapon, and has a melee attack range of 15 feet. On a hit, the target must roll 1d6.

The wielder of Netherfeng gains a bonus equal to their Agility score modifier to all attack rolls they make with the Relic. Netherfeng can be used as a light melee weapon or a ranged weapon. Whenever Netherfeng is used as a ranged weapon, the wielder can choose to either teleport to wherever the Relic lands as a Reaction or to have the Relic teleport back into their grasp as a Free Action.

**Old Wrath**  
Wrath is an ivory revolver made of ancient wood from the darkest forest. Wrath is a revolver with a misfire rate of 1 and an ammunition capacity of 4. Wrath does not become Broken from a misfire. Instead, if the wielder of Wrath misfires while using it, they become Corrupted. On a critical hit made with Wrath, the target becomes Wounded.   

**The Sword**  
Only a true hero can touch The Sword’s hilt. The blade is not as discriminating. The Sword has a +5 bonus to all attack rolls made with it, and is considered a magical light melee weapon.

Once per Rest, the wielder can spend 1 Action to cast 1 Cleric or Witch spell of their choice by holding the Sword towards the heavens.

## Hands of Ether
The Hands of Ether are the most pure of the Relics. Some dedicate their lives to obtain a Hand, making great sacrifices to wield their power. Some Hands find their way to worthy heroes in times of great need. The first Hands were given to the mortals by Elpo, the mother goddess, to ensure her creation’s protection from her treacherous brother’s malicious war on creation. Other Hands, given by lesser gods or created by enterprising mortals of great power, soon found their ways into the hearts of ancient forest tombs and forgotten halls in the bowels of other realms. To gain a Hand, an Adventurer must cut off their own hand.  

These are the Hands of Ether, wielded only by those at
the pinnacle of fate.
