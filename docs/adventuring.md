# Adventuring
Now that you have created an Adventurer, it’s time to take that Adventurer on a quest. Your Adventurer could be spurred into action through any number of events. Maybe they are seeking wealth, or notoriety. Maybe they are on a quest to oppose some great evil.  

Adventures typically involve traveling from place to place, delving into mysterious ruins, and surviving in wild and inhospitable places. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which Adventurers interact with and overcome challenges during their quests.  

## Travelling and Exploring
Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope; traveling from place to place can be just as harrowing and dangerous as combat in Hands of Ether. An individual Adventurer’s Speed is not taken into account while traveling with a group of long distances, as a group of Adventurers will typically travel together at roughly the same pace.  

The Guide will sometimes choose to summarize an adventuring party’s journey by narrating what happens between traveling from one destination to the next. They may describe the party traveling over an ancient stone bridge, fording a river, or laboriously ascending an icy mountain peak.  

Sometimes it is important, however, to know how long it takes to get from one place to another. Determining travel time depends solely on the agreed-upon travel pace of the adventuring group as well as the terrain they are traveling through. Traveling Adventurers can decide to move normally or quickly. Moving at a quickened pace lessens a party’s travel time by half, but could spell disaster for the group as a whole. Adventurers that travel at a quickened pace for an hour of time must make a Might check against a DC of 10 or lose 2 Stamina each.  

Some terrain, called Rough terrain, can be tiresome and difficult for a creature to move through. Swamps, a room filled with rubble, or uneven ground can slow down an Adventurer’s travel pace. While traveling long distances over Rough terrain, Adventurers must make a Might check against a DC of 10 or begin to lose Stamina at the Guide’s discretion.  

Movement through dangerous dungeons or the wilderness often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go. Climbing, swimming, or moving underwater are considered movement through Rough terrain. In some instances, an Adventurer may be required to make a check when moving over certain kinds of terrain. Wading or swimming through a rushing river or climbing a steep vertical cliff, for instance, may require a successful Might check to overcome.  

Lastly, Adventurers who fail to eat or drink for a long period of time while on a journey may begin to lose Stamina at the Guide's discretion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be cured until the affected Adventurer eats and drinks.

## Working Together - Aiding
Outside of combat, Adventurers can attempt to assist each other with certain tasks. Adventurers can only team up to conquer a task together if the task being performed can be done as a group activity. For instance, an Adventurer could not help another Adventurer pick a lock.  

A group of Adventurers could, however, work together to clear away a pile of rubble. In such occurrences, Adventurers can attempt to aid each other’s endeavors by making an Aid check. By default, Adventurers attempting to Aid each other do not add any modifiers to their 1d20 roll. The DC for Aid checks is always 10. On a success, an Adventurer attempting to Aid another Adventurer adds a +2 bonus to the final ability check result made by the Adventurer who is leading the effort.

## Falling, Traps, and Suffocation
There are a number of dangers involved in the exploration process. The most common of these are when an Adventurer suffers from a fall. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 damage for every 10 feet it falls past 20 feet. Falls from 20 feet or less are considered harmless. A creature who suffers damage from a fall lands Prone unless it reduces damage from the fall in some way, such as through the effects of a spell.  

Suffocation is the next most common threat to Adventurers. If a creature becomes covered in heavy rubble or finds themselves trapped underwater, they are at risk of suffocating. A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to its Might score modifier. If a creature is holding their breath during a combat encounter, however, that creature must make a successful Might check against a DC of 10 at the beginning of each of its turns as a Free Action.  

On a failure, the creature runs out of breath. If a creature runs out of breath, that creature loses all Health and becomes Unconscious and unstabilized. A suffocating creature can’t regain Health until it can breath again, and must begin making Mortality checks on each turn after it has fallen Unconscious from suffocation.  

Lastly, some areas explored by Adventurers may harbor traps. Traps can always be avoided with the proper caution and care, but unaware Adventurers could find an early demise as a result of triggering the release of toxic gas or falling into a spike pit.

## Obscured Areas and Stealth
The most fundamental tasks of adventuring is perceiving danger, finding hidden items, and attacking enemies during combat. All of these tasks rely heavily on an Adventurer’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision, such as dense fog, can prove to be a significant hindrance to even the most skilled Adventurer. Any given area may be visually obscured due to a number of varying factors, such as darkness or dense fog. Any creature within an obscured area is considered Blinded and Covered.  

Obscured areas can sometimes be advantageous to Adventurers. Sneaking and hiding is a viable strategy for most Adventurers, as combat is always a gamble of life or death. While sneaking, Adventurers cannot hide in plain sight. There must be some form of cover, such as an obscured area, darkness, furniture, or trees in order for a creature to hide or sneak. Agility checks are used to sneak, hide, and move stealthily, and Wit checks are used to notice hidden or sneaking creatures.

## Interacting with Objects
Interacting with the environment is the most common activity Adventurers partake in, and can be done freely outside of combat encounters. The Adventurer expresses to the Guide how they would like to interact with the environment, and the Guide relays what, if anything, occurs as a result of that Adventurer’s actions.  

For example, an Adventurer might decide to pull a lever, which may result in the raising of a portcullis or to cause a room to flood with water. If the lever is rusted in position, however, an Adventurer might need to make a successful Might check in order to wrench the lever into place.  

Adventurers can also damage items with their weapons and spells. The Guide determines an item’s Defense and Health, and whether it can be hurt. Objects always fail Might and Agility checks, and they are immune to effects that require other checks. When an item reaches 0 Health, it becomes Broken. An Adventurer could also attempt a Might check to break an item. The Guide determines the DC for such a check.

## Bulk
Each item, creature, and structure has an amount of Bulk. Bulk is used to describe how much space an item takes up, how cumbersome it is to hold or carry, and how heavy an it is. For instance, a staff is 1 Bulk not because it is heavy, but because it is longer than the creature wielding it, and therefore somewhat cumbersome. Orbs are 1 Bulk because they are dense and heavy, despite being small in size.  

Some items, such as potions, have no Bulk at all. Items that are considered both lightweight and that can be held in the palm of the hand are bulkless. Bulkless items can be carried without burdening an Adventurer in any capacity. An Adventurer can carry an amount of Bulk equal to their Might. If an Adventurer begins carrying an amount of Bulk that exceeds their Bulk limit, they become Encumbered.

## Rest
After a long day of exploration and courageous endeavors, most Adventurers will want to bed down and recover. Taking a Rest requires 6 hours of uninterrupted downtime. A typical Rest is spent tending to chipped armor, patching wounds, catching up with comrades, and ultimately sleeping for the night.  

Upon taking a proper Rest, a creature naturally regains their maximum Health, Mana, Mortality, and Stamina. Adventurers will not naturally recover from Wounds, Corruptions, or curses during a Rest, and must be cured of these afflictions in some other way. Resting in harsh conditions, such as in a blizzard without tents and a fire, may do more harm than good. An Adventurer attempting to Rest in uncomfortable conditions must make a Might check against a DC of 10. On a failure, that Adventurer will not regain any Stamina or Mortality, but they do regain their Health and Mana as usual.

## Coin and Downtime
In Hands of Ether, there is one form of currency - Coin. Coin could look or act like however you’d like in your own game’s world. Coin could be bullets, tickets, doubloons, chunks of crystal or even actual coins. Adventurers can use their Coin to purchase usable items and other rewards within the world. Your Guide will have a list of items your party can buy for varying amounts of Coin. Coin is hard to come by, so shop wisely.  

Coin is most often used during downtime. Your Adventurer doesn’t go delving into dungeons each and every day. Every Adventurer needs a break; a time to ease the stress of dungeon diving and dangerous combat. Outside of battling evil and exploring forgotten tombs, Adventurers are still people, and people need Rest and recuperation.  

Between adventures, you may have the opportunity to take part in some downtime. You can do whatever you wish during this time of refreshment. Give your Adventurer a hot bath and a big meal. Beyond spending Coin, Adventurers can spend their downtime doing any activities they wish. Maybe your Bard spends his time building his own hand-made lute, or your Cleric wishes to study and pray in the local monastery. It is important to spend time discussing what each Adventurer decides to do during their respective respite from the adventure.
