# Gnome

Curious and introspective, Gnomes are tiny woodland folk with pointed ears and big beards. They enjoy isolated lives hidden within hollowed trees and forest hovels. Gnomes appreciate hot cider, books, and smoking dark herbs. Gnomes spend most of their day tending to their claimed land, chopping wood and gardening around their woodland havens. Gnomes are solitary, but are the only woodland folk who will band together and take up arms in protection of their wilderness and peaceful lifestyle.
