# Avatar

Angelic creatures touched by an otherworldly presence, or born with powers from another realm. The Avatar can be touched by the fey realm or the shadow realm, granting them strange planar powers. Most Avatars, however, simply have a drop of divine blood in them, and take on the appearance of ivory- skinned folk with silvery hair. Most bare a mark on their skin that brands them as a descendant of some Etheric spirit.
