# Drake

Scaled skin and reptilian snouts make these elemental beings a fearsome sight. Each Drake is empowered with a certain element of their choice; acid, electricity, fire, ice, or poison. Akin to dragons and other great lizards, they are prone to greed and violence. Most Drakes can barely cooperate within the confines of society, and prefer to rove the wilderness as bandits or mercenaries. Due to their hardy constitution, most Drakes thrive in extreme climates.
