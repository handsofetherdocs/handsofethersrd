# Dwarf

Stout, sturdy folk that value heritage, hard work, and boisterous conversation. Dwarves yearn for mead, minerals, and brotherhood. Mining and forging has become ingrained in their culture as a result of long lives lived entirely beneath the surface. This traditional lifestyle has made most of them callous to other species of mortal folk.
