# Zurn

Round bodied and smooth-featured, the stoic Zurn come from the darkest reaches of the crystal woodlands. Reflective of their homeland, their bodyâ€™s are encrusted with a shell of vibrant crystals. They subside off minerals, and adorn themselves with thick, bright robes. They are especially talented at diplomacy and calming others, and have childlike features.

### Lineage Skills
**Crystal Melody.** Once per Rest, Zurn can cause their crystals to resonate with the Ether and release waves of recovering magic outwards. Each ally the Zurn can see regains 1d4 Mana.

**Herald.** Figures of leadership will always pay attention to, hold council with, and consider the plights or messages of a Zurn. This is especially true if the Zurn makes a dramatic entrance into a meeting place, and even more so if the Zurn is holding a staff.
