# Kryn

Hulking insectoid people from the deep wood. Their shining carapace shells protect them from the elements, and serve as an ironic pairing to their compassionate and soft-hearted nature. They are charitable and hard-working above all else, value life in all forms, and have a culture dedicated to the making of and appreciation of music. Some Kryn are so dedicated to their art that they often modify their beetle-like shells into makeshift woodwind instruments, carving their hollow legs and arms into flutes and wind whistles.
