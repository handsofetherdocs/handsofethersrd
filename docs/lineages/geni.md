# Geni

The speckle-skinned Geni are gruesome warmongers empowered by the elemental forces of nature. They are radically insular, with soft features and tall heads. Their skin is reflective of their elemental heritage, often times dripping with water or glowing red with molten fire. Choose an elemental heritage from either earth, fire, electricity, or ice and water.
