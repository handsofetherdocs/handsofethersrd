# Golem

Humanoids made from silver, brass, wood, iron, or some other material and powered by arcane forces. Despite their origins, these intricate automatons can think and feel just as well as other humanoids. Most Golems are powered or embodied by the soul of a once-living creature, such as an executed criminal or a late pet a noble family refused to part with.

### Lineage Skills
**Mechanical Constitution.** Due to their especially tough wooden and iron frames, Golems can shrug off minor damage. If a Golem would take 1 damage from an attack or spell, they instead take no damage.

**Iron Lung.** Due to their inorganic nature, Golems cannot suffocate or drown.
