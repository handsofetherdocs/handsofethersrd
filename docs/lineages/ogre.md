# Ogre

These massive, yellow-skinned brutes have elongated heads and massive jaws. They grow very little hair, and often give into their violent and monstrous instincts. They are descended from giants, and can sometimes grow up to a height of nine feet tall. Ogres enjoy chewing and rubbing minerals, and decorate their tribeâ€™s caverns with carved bones.
