# Dym

Often called tieflings or deeplings, these are beings with fiendish or demonic blood. They are typically adorned with vibrant skin, curled horns, and spade- tipped tails. They flourish in the hellish heat of the desert, and their penchant for the diabolical leads them down paths of manipulation and violence. Some have been known to break the mold, turning their malice into selflessness. Their horns come in many shapes and sizes, and their skin can be any hue, making each Dym distinct in a very obvious way.
