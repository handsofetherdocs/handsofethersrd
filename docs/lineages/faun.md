# Faun

With thick fur, cloven hooves, and floppy ears, these chipper creatures come from the realm of fairies. They are inquisitive and jovial, and very rarely wear clothes. Most are still attuned to the fey realm itself, and must struggle to understand and adapt to the mortal realm. They choose their own names, which are more often than not inspired by the elements of the natural world.
