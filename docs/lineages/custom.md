# Custom Lineages
Maybe your heritage is that of a species or culture that is not listed as a default lineage. If the species of your Adventurer is not listed as a default lineage, you can use the following rules to create a new lineage.  

Firstly, copy the following form onto a piece of blank paper and fill in the blanks to describe what your lineage’s culture is like. If you so wish, you can also use this template to elaborate on the culture of an already established default lineage, as well.  

My people are known as the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

We people value \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and despise \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

We stand at a height of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ tall, and wear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Our most notable physical feature is our \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

We wield \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and are talented with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Our role in the world is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Next, choose your lineage’s properties. You can add up to 2 separate ability score improvements of +1 to any ability scores of your choice, or 1 improvement of +2 to a single ability score of your choice.  

If your lineage’s size is small, their Health at first level is 6 and their Health at higher levels is 1d6. If their size is medium, their Health at first level is 8 and their Health at higher levels is 1d8. Large species are far more rare, and have a Health of 10 at first level and a Health of 1d10 at higher levels.  

A lineage's Speed can range anywhere from 20 to 40 depending on their natural agility and the length of their legs. Regardless, a creature’s Speed must always be a multiple of 10. Work with your Guide to establish a reasonable Speed for your custom lineage.  

Lastly, choose 2 lineage skills to apply to your newly created lineage. You could choose these skills from the general skill list, any class skill list, or any lineage skill list.
