# Nova

Desert wanderers with war in their blood. These sturdy warriors have large pointed ears, silky white manes of hair, and soft violet skin speckled with luminous flakes of silver. They value honor in combat above all else, and are trained to smith and use their own weapons from a very young age. At night, they sleep standing up, eyes open, peering into the night sky.
