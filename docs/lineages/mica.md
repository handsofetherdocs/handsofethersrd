# Mica

Cunning, fur-covered humanoids with swine-like noses, lanky limbs, and an affinity for precious stones and reflective trinkets. They live as either feral thieves in the jungle or as enterprising merchants within settlements. Mica have an eye for wealth, and are innately proficient in appraising items and trinkets. Being a hardy and bestial species, they could be skilled warriors but tend to shy away from confrontation.
