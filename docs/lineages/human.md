### Lineage Skills
**Blend In.** Being the most common species, Humans find it easy to not draw attention. Humans roll with advantage when making a Will check in an attempt to barter, persuade, or remain unnoticed when dealing with denizens of a settlement.

**Worldly.** Humans are adaptable above all else, and often obtain more talents and practices than other lineages during their short lifetime. Humans begin at level 1 with 2 skills of their choice instead of 1. This extra skill can be chosen from the Humanâ€™s class skill list or the general skill list.
