# Drow

Gaunt, coal-skinned elves with amber eyes that prefer cold and wet climates. They live in and around brine- encrusted seaside caverns, and subside off of a diet of fish and spices. Most have bitter demeanors, and prefer their own company. They worship their ancestors, and perform sacred rites of self- mortification to seek their forbearerâ€™s attention.
