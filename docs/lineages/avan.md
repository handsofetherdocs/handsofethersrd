# Avan

Small feathered humanoids with a history of trickery and deceit. The Avan’s plumage takes on a great variety of differing hues and patterns. Some have beaks, and others do not. Their light, feathered forms help them move quickly and agilely. They are a swift species with an unmatched ingenuity. Their nimble hands and inclination for trickery often result in them pursuing lives of crime and theatrics. Avans come from the wet woods to the south.
