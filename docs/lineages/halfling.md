# Halfling

Boisterous folk of small, plump stature, with big feet and childish features. Halflings live a life of leisure in homey villages, and view each other as one big extended family. Their favorite pastime is eating, and often only venture from the comfort of their homes to attend massive festivals celebrating community, family, and food. Halflings are not adventurous, and despise conflict.

### Lineage Skills
**Oft Overlooked.** During combat, enemies will never attack a Halfling unless all of the Halflingâ€™s allies have already become Unconscious or the Halfling inflicts damage to another creature using an attack roll or a harmful spell.

**Sensitive Nose.** Halflings roll with advantage on all Wit checks made to perceive their surroundings through scent.
