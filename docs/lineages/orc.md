# Orc

Lanky folk with arms that reach their knees and skin colored in vibrant greens, teals, and yellows. Orc culture is gentle, peaceful, and inundated with mysticism. Their culture is centered around the fabled green clay. Their priests pray over it, and their people eat it. Some Orcs reject their traditions, choosing instead to embrace their physical advantages and become violent marauders.
