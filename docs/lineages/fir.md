# Fir

These towering, teal-skinned rovers of the wilderness have bestial noses and lean frames. They live in tribal communities, and rarely interact with civilized society. The more traditional among them wear wooden masks adorned with spiraling symbols that depict their heritage, pasts, interests, and ambitions. Firs have wide, pointed ears, glistening black eyes, and wide shoulders. They are pragmatic in their daily routines, and deeply spiritual in their beliefs.
