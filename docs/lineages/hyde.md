# Hyde

A resilient, slender species with olive skin, unblinking reptilian eyes, and analytical minds. Once a family of monstrous serpentine creatures, the Hyde’s predicted extinction was cut short by a pact made with a fey spirit. They live on now as a hybrid of spirit and mortal, organizing opportunistic criminal acts of immense magnitude. These shadowy figures consistently and recklessly push the boundaries of technology and spiritualism.
