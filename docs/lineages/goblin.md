# Goblin

Once thought of as monstrous vermin, these hunched, green-skinned people are now valued as adept Adventurers due to their cunning and ingenuity. They have jagged teeth and serpentine eyes, and only live to be around thirty years old. After surviving centuries of hate and abuse, they have become quick-witted escape artists.
