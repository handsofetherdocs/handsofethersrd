# Catastrophes
The world of Hands of Ether is a chaotic and dangerous one. Of the many threats that Adventurers face, the catastrophes listed in the following tables are the most extreme. Sometimes luck is in favor of the Adventurer, and the result of a catastrophic event could be exactly what they need at a pivotal moment. Most of the time, however, catastrophes should be avoided at all costs. Catastrophes always occur as a Reaction, and it is suggested that the result of most catastrophes be rolled or determined by the Guide. Catastrophic Events come in four forms.  

Arcane Anomalies are the most common form of catastrophe. Magic is a chaotic force that can often spiral out of control. It is a force that even casters themselves hardly understand. Magic thinks, feels, and can and will often betray those that attempt to wield it, no matter their prowess.  

Corruption is when a creature is cursed, tormented, or driven insane either of their own accord or by the hand of another being. Avoiding Corruption is detrimental to an Adventurer's mental and emotional wellbeing. A number of unholy or deeply evil things could cause Corruption to afflict an Adventurer, with the most common cause of Corruption being the stress of adventuring itself.  

Mechanical Mishaps occur when some form of technology goes malfunctions. An alchemist could splash acid into his eyes by accident or a smith could scald himself on a freshly heated blade. These effects, although harmful, are easily and quickly cured.  

Lastly, the most detrimental catastrophe that an Adventurer could face is a Wound. Sometimes Adventurers will sustain an injury that is so brutal and gruesome that they are unable to heal them from Rest or natural recovery. These lingering injuries can still be healed by certain spells and abilities, but for the most part should be avoided at all costs.
