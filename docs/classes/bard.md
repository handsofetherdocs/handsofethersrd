 * <u>Sword:</u> You twist roots and rhymes around a branch you have collected. The branch becomes a sword of wood. A crystal centers itself into the hilt, climbing out of the wood’s grains. The sword is dull when you wish it to be, and sharp when it needs to be. You are considered proficient with this sword, even if you lack melee proficiency. On a hit, the sword deals 1d6 damage + your Will score modifier, and the target must succeed a Will check against a DC of 10 or begin to suffer from dark hallucinations of the forest’s wrath.

You can place this golden fern on the brow of an ally. That ally becomes immune to poisons and toxins until their next Rest. In addition, that ally becomes Stabilized as a Reaction whenever they first fall Unconscious before their next Rest. Wind  

 * <u>Word:</u> You can shout into the Ether to send a message. Your words ride the Ether, and arrive in the wind near their destination. These words can cause fear in your enemies, joy in your allies, or beseech more powerful beings for help in times of need. Your words are purest and loudest when they are desperate. Otherwise, there is a limited degree of failure to this bardic ritual.
