# Classes
Each Adventurer has their own methods they rely on to assist them when delving the depths of dungeons or battling monstrous foes. Typically, these skill sets are naturally adopted by them as a result of their background or lifestyle.  

Some Adventurers lived early lives of desperation, surviving as urchins and thieves to gain the skills of the Rogue. Others may have heard a higher calling, charged with protecting innocents in the name of the gods that fuel their magic; these Adventurers became Clerics.  

Classes are a framework of rules and abilities that help to determine how your Adventurer functions. Are they spell casters who rely on magical tricks to shield them from danger? Do they rely on their training as a former city guard, knowing that the use of a sword and shield is the best method to solve problems?  

There are ten core classes in Hands of Ether. Each class has its own list of skills to choose from. You can choose skills from either your class skill list or the general skill list. You can choose these skills in any order you wish throughout the course of your adventure. These skills determine exactly who your Adventurer is and what they are capable of, so choose wisely.  

Most importantly, each class has a primary ability. The primary ability an Adventurer possesses is the most important part of their class, as it determines what that Adventurer’s role is in an adventuring party.  

If you wish to be more supportive and selfless to your adventuring companions, the Sage’s Discern ability can reveal the weaknesses of foes and other hints to overcoming challenges that your party faces. If you want to be in the thick of combat, shielding your comrades from harm and dealing damage to your enemies, a Knight or a Warrior’s primary abilities may be more befitting of your Adventurer.  

The descriptors of each class in this section, like every rule in Hands of Ether, are merely guidelines. You determine how your Adventurer acts and who they are. These classes determine your Adventurer’s abilities, not the entirety of their personality, motivations, past, or identity.
