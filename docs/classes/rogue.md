# Rogue  
Some Rogues are nimble thieves or stealthy assassins, slinking through shadows and leaping across rooftops in pursuit of ill-gotten gains. Others use their criminal connections and cunning to further their goals, and prowl the dark reaches of city underbellies to gamble, smuggle, and grift the unknowing populace. Whatever their motivations, Rogues specialize in trickery, deceit, and discretion. Rogues  excel  at  finding  and  exploiting  the vulnerabilities of others, inside and outside of combat.
