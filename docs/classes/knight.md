# Knight  
Knights are servants, protectors, and enforcers to an oath, bond, or mission. They adorn themselves in heavy armor and wield hefty weaponry to protect
themselves and their allies during their crusades of devotion, and to crush those that defy them. Some Knights are devoted to a certain noble or ruler, while others dedicate themselves to a deity who shares their virtues and tenants.    

Due to their drive to protect that which they are devoted to, Knights are masters of warding and protection. Their unwavering devotion combined with their  tactical  prowess  make  them  fearsome combatants.  

### Primary Ability Score
Might

## Primary Ability: **Guard**
**Cost: 1 Action**  
You raise your shield to protect an ally from harm. You can grant an ally within your default melee range a bonus to their Defense equal to your currently wielded shield’s Defense bonus. This ability uses the same rules as raising a shield to protect yourself would normally use, but benefits your chosen ally instead of yourself.  

If you would gain any additional benefits from raising a shield due to your skills or a spell’s effects, your Guarded ally gains those benefits as well. An ally’s Defense bonus they gain from being Guarded ends early if that ally moves outside of your default melee range or if you fall Unconscious.
