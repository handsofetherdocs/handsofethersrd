# Witch  
Witches draw their magic from both the primal energies of nature as well as the eldritch traditions of the occult. Their power is not learned or harnessed, but is instead bargained for. Each Witch gains their power from an otherworldly being or spirit in exchange for either their servitude, soul, or an oath of some sort.  

Most of these patrons are innately tied to either the world of shadow or the world of nature, and the Witch’s powers reflect that. Their spells are manifestations of nature and the darkness within it. Witches use their magic to maim and curse their foes, and are often plagued by suspicion and misunderstanding from others.
