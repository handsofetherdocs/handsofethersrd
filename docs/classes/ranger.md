# Ranger  
Rangers are wild people, navigators, and protectors of the  boundaries  between  civilization  and  the wilderness. Rangers are proficient at surviving and navigating untamed environments. They utilize stealth and resourcefulness in their missions of preservation and retribution. They often specialize in hunting monstrosities, maintaining peace between society and the outlands. Sometimes shunned or outcast for their feral demeanor, Rangers typically live a solitary life. Due to their feral acuity and natural obscurity, they are known to be especially adept with ranged weaponry.
