# Magic
Some Adventurers rely on sword and shield, their quick wits, or their training to overcome challenges. Some, however, use the powerful forces of magic to succeed in their endeavors. Whether it is traversing a dangerous crypt or fending off does, magic is a rare but powerful tool in the Adventurer’s arsenal.  

Most Adventurers will encounter magical devices on their travels. Adventurers must be proficient in Artifacts to use them without suffering from an untrained penalty.  

The exception to this rule is the use of enchanted combat gear, which can be used by any Adventurer who is proficient in that type of weapon, armor, or shield.  

Other Adventurers have the ability to wield magic itself. If an Adventurer is a caster, there are a number of rules that apply to them. Firstly, a spell known by a caster can only be cast if the caster currently possesses the Mana required to cast that spell. The caster must also have at least one hand free and unoccupied in order to cast any spells. Lastly, some spells require special components in order to cast. Spells that require such components will describe the exact requirements needed in order to cast them.

## Casting Terminology
pells sometimes have a few terms within their descriptions that are used to describe certain properties and limitations of the magic that is being cast.  

The casting time of a spell is how many Actions the caster must spend before the effects of that spell occur. Some spells cost a caster more Actions than they possess per round. If a caster begins casting such a spell, they may continue their casting process on their subsequent turns until that spell’s required amount of Actions are spent by the caster. The effects of the spell then occur. All casters can do this by default unless a caster’s casting process is interrupted.  

For instance, if a spell requires 3 Actions to cast and the caster only has 2 Actions per round, that caster’s spell will activate on their 3rd Action spent casting that spell during their next subsequent turn during the following round. If a caster is casting a spell and decides to use their 3rd Action to open a door instead of completing their casting process, their spell fails and the casting process must be restarted to activate that spell’s effects. By default, a caster’s spell can only ever be interrupted in three different ways; if the caster becomes Stunned, becomes Unconscious, or they choose to interrupt their own casting to perform a different activity. Certain skills and abilities can also halt caster’s casting.  

Mana cost is how much Mana is required by the caster to spend in order to cast a spell. If a spell fails or is interrupted before it can be successfully cast, no Mana is spent or lost. A caster’s Mana is only ever spent whenever a spell’s effects occur.The duration of a spell is how long a spell’s effects last. If the spell’s duration is instant, that spell’s effects happen immediately but do not continue unless otherwise stated or implied within the spell’s description. Otherwise, all of a spell’s listed effects end whenever the duration ends unless otherwise stated. If a spell’s duration is forever, the effects of that spell are permanent by default.  

Range is the distance at which a spell can designate, affect, or hit a target. By default, a spell’s point of origin is its caster’s current position. Some spells, such as Fume, allow the caster to designate a point of origin for their spell within that spell’s range. If a target is outside of a spell’s range, it cannot be targeted or affected by that spell.

## Spell Effects on Ability Scores
Sometimes, certain spells may hinder or cripple a creature’s ability scores or minor scores. If such an event occurs, scores that are decreased or altered do not affect other scores that they are related to. For example, a spell that would reduce a target’s Agility score would not reduce a target’s Defense. This rule is true for both ability scores and minor scores; spells that would reduce a target’s Defense would not reduce that target’s Agility score, either.  

If a spell effect grants a creature a bonus to a score, such spell effects are always added together. For instance, if a Mage and a Cleric both separately cast spells that grant a +1 bonus to the Defense of a creature, that creature gains a +2 bonus to Defense until one of either spells casted has ended. In other words, spell effects always stack.

## Creating New Spells
By no means should a caster’s magical potential or power be limited to the spells within this manual. The spells listed in the default spell lists are merely a suggestive guideline for the ways magic could be utilized in Hands of Ether. Magic is both powerful and malleable. A caster should be able to use magic to produce any effect within reason. If an Adventurer wishes to gain a spell or cantrip that is of their own design, they should discuss their idea with their Guide outside of gameplay to determine the parameters and rules of this new spell. It is the responsibility of the Guide to compromise with the player’s spell idea and to balance its powers and effects accordingly.  

Narratively, a newly created spell should fall under the same form of magic as an Adventurer’s class. For instance, if the Adventurer is a Cleric, their spells should be based around healing or bolstering either their allies or themselves. If the Adventurer is a Witch, their spell should be themed around either hindering their enemies or manipulating the harmful elements of nature.  

Like all spells, your newly created spell must have a casting time, a mana cost, a duration, and a range. Cooperate with your Guide in order to determine what these spell properties should be, as well as what the spell’s effects are and how it accomplishes them.

## Choosing New Spells
When choosing a new spell for your Adventurer to gain, be considerate of that spell’s Mana cost. As you can choose to gain any spell from your class’s spell list, it is possible to gain spells which you cannot cast due to your maximum Mana being too low.  

Some skills allow an Adventurer to gain additional spells. Such skills can vary greatly in their limitations and specifications. Most importantly, Adventurers can gain new spells through skills past their maximum amount of known spells. Adventurers who are not casters can take a number of skills that grant them spells, as well. More often than not, these particular skills allow an Adventurer to cast certain spells once per Rest.

## A Note on Cantrips
Any mentions of using or gaining spells within a skill’s description should be assumed to include the use or gaining of cantrips as well. Cantrips are considered spells, despite costing an Adventurer no Mana. If a skill describes the casting or use of a spell, the same rules described also include the casting or use of cantrips. An Adventurer, for instance, may gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls made with spells. If that Adventurer were to cast a cantrip which calls for an attack roll, they would also apply this +2 bonus to that cantrip’s attack roll.
