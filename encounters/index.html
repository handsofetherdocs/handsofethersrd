<h1 id="encounters">Encounters<a class="headerlink" href="#encounters" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Adventurers who journey beyond the safety of city walls will at some inevitable point come face to face with bandits, monsters, dangerous guilds, or dark spirits. Adversaries come in all shapes and sizes.   </p>
<p>Monsters and other adversaries have no default statistics within the game. It is suggested that the Guide creates their own enemies to fit their unique setting. Creating enemies and monsters for your adventure is a simple task, as creatures in Hands of Ether always have the same types of statistics.   </p>
<p>Each creature,  including each player-controlled Adventurer, has four primary ability scores and eight minor scores. For monsters, the eight minor scores are rarely used during combat and can be ignored when creating a monster’s statistics. Each creature also has a primary ability and a number of skills or spells. For simplicity’s sake, it is suggested that each enemy your Adventurer’s face has three or less skills or spells in addition to their primary ability. Any more spells or skills could be too challenging to control during the confusion of running a smooth combat encounter.</p>
<h2 id="crafting-enemies">Crafting Enemies<a class="headerlink" href="#crafting-enemies" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>To create a humanoid enemy to challenge your players with,  simply create an appropriately leveled Adventurer. A challenge for a group of Adventurers is one enemy who is 1 level above them. A few level 2 enemies are a fair challenge to a group of four or less level 1 player-controlled Adventurers.   </p>
<p>You can create monsters in this manner as well, but with much less limitation. As an example, a hag that a group of Adventurers are battling may have a few Witch skills and a few Rogue skills, creating a unique and powerful creature who specializes in both dark magic and subterfuge.   </p>
<p>The two most important scores to consider when creating a custom enemy is their Health and Defense. Scores other than Health and Defense could be used, but it is not necessary.  </p>
<p>The Defense of an enemy creature can be determined by considering their size as well as any armoring they may possess. A giant is a big target, and therefore should be easier to hit. A Defense of 8 is a good starting score for such a creature. A dragon, however, has natural armor in the form of thick scales. For this reason, a dragon may have a Defense of 12 despite their size.  </p>
<p>Health is the most important factor when creating an enemy. To determine an appropriate amount of Health for a custom enemy, add each of your Adventurer’s levels together and then multiple by three.  </p>
<p>(Three level 10 Adventurers = 30. 30 x 3 = 90).  </p>
<p>90 Health is an appropriate amount of Health for a fair but challenging encounter for three level  10 Adventurers.  </p>
<p>Although creating your own monsters and enemies is suggested, this manual also contains a number of monsters and enemies to challenge your Adventurers with. The following creatures can be used as a guideline to help you design and create your own adversaries, as well.  </p>
<p>Each enemy in this manual has a unique property called a Challenge Rating (CR). This is a score used to judge how difficult a monster is to defeat in combat, and is directly related to the current level of the adventuring party. A Challenge Rating of 1, for example, is considered a challenging but manageable enemy for a group of three level 1 Adventurers to battle.   </p>
<p>Each of the following enemies also has a weakness. Weaknesses are secret vulnerabilities of a creature that can greatly assist Adventurers in battle. Weaknesses could be revealed to the party through a Sage’s Discern ability, or through the party searching old libraries for answers on how to best defeat their enemy.  </p>
<h2 id="situational-encounters">Situational Encounters<a class="headerlink" href="#situational-encounters" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes Adventurers may face a foe that is not a typical monster or group of bandits. Natural disasters, mobs of angry villagers, or swarms of rats work just like other adversaries in this game. They have Health, skills, and other statistics. Guides are free to create their own unconventional encounters just as they would any other monster, but the following list of prepared adversaries contains a few examples of such circumstantial challenges.<br />

<h3 id="wrong-elf">Wrong Elf<a class="headerlink" href="#wrong-elf" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Twisted in the darkness, the once proud and
intellectually advanced Athaki have become a primal,
ferocious shadow of their former selves. They now
wander the caverns beneath the surface in small
clusters, surviving day by day and using scavenged
weaponry to catch spelunkers, treasure hunters, and
miners by surprise. These pallid, conal-headed
gremlins rely on guerrilla tactics to gain an edge, and
are constantly in a state of desperation as they
struggle to survive in the forgotten halls of their once
great civilization.  </p>
<p>Their spherical black eyes and bleached blue skin is a
fearsome sight, but they are weak and fragile
creatures on their own. Wrong-Elves are rarely seen
alone, and are never encountered in the daylight or on
the surface. The Wrong-elves have an obsession with
trinkets of a technological nature; an instinctual echo of
their ancestor’s once curious and enterprising nature.</p>

<h3 id="tavern">Tavern<a class="headerlink" href="#tavern" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>An interwoven, flailing sea of greasy, weathered limbs and broken glass. If an Adventurer starts trouble in a tavern, weary and bored townsfolk will leap at any opportunity to escalate their local drinking hole’s entropy in the name of entertainment alone. A pub fight is not typically a lethal encounter, unless the offense is worthy of execution or some ill-fated accident occurs in the confusion, but it can be a challenging one to most Adventurers. Adventurers who get knocked out by the Tavern Brawl awaken in less than fortunate conditions. If all Adventurers in the party are knocked out before they reduce the Brawl to 0 Health, they awaken in the settlement’s prison, and are Exhausted.

<h3 id="slythen">Slythen<a class="headerlink" href="#slythen" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Ancient wyrms from the realm of the fae, the Slythen moves its long body across the forest floor with the aid of hundreds of vaguely humanoid legs. Its body is covered in pastel fur that oozes with a paralyzing toxin, and its alien head is constantly swiveling around in search of trinkets to steal and flesh to consume. A prehensile tongue wrapped in its slobbering maw is used to restrain and capture not only sustenance, but items and items that the Slythen finds fascinating. The Slythen has an instinctual and unbridled compulsion to hoard. Being compulsive in its collecting and nomadic in its lifestyle, it has evolved a cavity within its caterpillar-like body to store its stolen belongings. This cavity runs down the entirety of the Slythen’s frame. Food and nourishment eaten by the Slythen is absorbed by its stomach acids within this cavity, but its hoarded items remain tucked away, forgotten and covered in deadly secretions.   </p>

<h3 id="fur-hag">Fur Hag<a class="headerlink" href="#fur-hag" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Wrapped in uncured skins and decaying hides, these vile, lurching creatures make their homes in the wilderness near settlements. They draw their power from fear, frustration, and anguish. To harvest this emotional sustenance, they use their cunning and spell craft to plague a chosen local populace with schemes of mysterious torment. Fur Hags will kidnap children, lynch innocent villagers during the night, poison a town’s water, or corrupt nearby animals in their attempts to cause a settlement disease and paranoia. Fur Hags value self-preservation, however, and are not typically bold in their plots. These evil acts can sometimes take place months apart from each other, but are more often than not done in a pattern of some kind due to the Fur Hag’s necessity for feeding off a population’s negative emotional energy. Their appearance is far from humanoid, and is more akin to a shambling mass or pile of fur, skin, bones, teeth, and body parts.   </p>

<h3 id="horror">Horror<a class="headerlink" href="#horror" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>The Horror originates within the darkest reaches of mortal kin’s imagination. It is fear, torment, and disgust incarnate. Their appearance is apt; that of a pale, tentacled, egg-shaped being of immense size that inexplicably floats through the air in a ghostly and eerie manner. The creature is able to warp reality around itself to terrifying extents, and innately able to cast dark spells from its tentacles. A singular large eye stares ahead from within the Horror’s floating form, unblinking and perpetually seeking out its next source of nourishment to sustain its unending hunger for flesh and fear. Three other eyes are sunken into pockets of flesh at the tip of each of its tentacles, which dangle from underneath its gargantuan form. Horrors are an immense threat, and most Adventurers should be more inclined to fleeing from them rather than standing their ground against such a fearsome abomination.   </p>

<h3 id="ichor-lord">Ichor Lord<a class="headerlink" href="#ichor-lord" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>A decrepit, evil spirit from the realm of shadows that seeks to twist and control the mortal realm. They are parasitic, taking control of a mortal vessel as a means of defilement and a tool of trickery and locomotion. The Ichor Lord takes on qualities of its host, and often exaggerates them, creating a new personality for itself. This ironic corruption serves as both a means of terrorizing innocent mortals and to entertain the Ichor Lord itself. The Ichor Lord causes corruption, insanity, decay, disease, infection, repulsion, and illness with no remorse, and has no qualms about its place in the world. It consideres its role in the world to be a divine art, but has no ego. It knows what it lusts after and appreciates the journey to it. It would rather ruin the lives of innocent mortals and revel in their suffering than kill them. Battling such an entity is sure to result in a very slow, torturous death in the most humiliating and dreadful manner imaginable.   </p>

<h3 id="crystal-dragon">Crystal Dragon<a class="headerlink" href="#crystal-dragon" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>These ancient, Etheric beings have long lost their way due to their maddening immortality. They use powerful magic unknown to mortals to further their goals and strike fear into the heart of lesser creatures. Hidden deep below the surface, they manufacture cunning schemes in order to grasp at the power and dominance they so desperately hunger for. They often utilizevastnetworksof ruthlesslydeterminedminions to act out their will on the surface. These minions are sometimes cunning and powerful themselves, working in unison with the Crystal Dragon in exchange for a promised sliver of greater power. Most of the minions, however, give into the Dragon’s cruelty and foreboding presence, viewing their servitude as the only path of escape from the Crystal Dragon’s maddening influence. The Crystal Dragons come in many shapes and shades, but are always heavily encrusted with chunks of raw minerals that grow from their scales. These crystals grow in whatever manner the dragon wishes, and are often twisted into jagged crowns atop the dragon’s head - a symbol of their twisted egomania. The Crystal Dragon can fly at a rate equal to its Speed, and can innately see Invisible creatures.   </p>
