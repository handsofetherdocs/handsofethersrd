<h1 id="guide">Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#guide" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Most knowledge, rules, and mechanics a Guide will need to understand before running the game are already heavily discussed in former chapters of this manual. There are a number of concepts, however, that a Guide should familiarize themselves with in order to better simulate the nature of the world during moments of improvisation. A Guide should strive to always be ready to improvise a ruling based on the particular situations their players are experiencing. Let the Adventurer’s actions and your own common sense drive your rulings and story. The following tools can aid you in those times of improvisation, to better understand how the game functions, and to find more joy in your role as a Guide to adventure.  </p>
<h2 id="the-guides-role">The Guide's Role<a class="headerlink" href="#the-guides-role" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>As the Guide, you are the driving force behind the adventure. You act as a mediator for fairness and order between the players and their challenges, as well as the crafter of those challenges. You act as the narrator and host of the adventure. You inhabit and embody each and every creature and character within the world that isn’t controlled by the players. Beyond presenting the setting of the adventure, you will also act as the judge and interpreter of the game’s rules and the game world’s properties.   </p>
<p>This game belongs to you and your players. Consider the entirety of this manual a long and intricate list of suggestions, and nothing more. No one knows your players, your table, your plans, or your idea of fun better than you do. This manual serves merely as a means of inspiration.   </p>
<p>Above all else, you and your player’s own enjoyment of the game should be your primary concern. Bend, twist, and break these rules to fit your needs. If something doesn’t work, change it. If you don’t like something, scrap it. Be adaptable, be ever attentive to your player’s needs, and remember that this entire manual should be viewed as a malleable tool for the purpose of entertaining your players and yourself, rather than a strict code of operation.  </p>
<h2 id="materials-required-to-play">Materials Required to Play<a class="headerlink" href="#materials-required-to-play" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>It is highly suggested that Guides first read through the Adventurer rules found throughout this manual. It is integral that you understand your player’s mechanics and capabilities as a frame of reference for crafting your story and challenges.  </p>
<p>Beyond this manual, you will only need a set of die, pencils, paper, and your imagination. These are the only tools required to run the game. It is suggested to all Guides that they use a screen; some form of vertical barrier made of wood, cardboard, or another similar material to block their player’s line of sight so that no secrets within the Guide’s notes are revealed or spoiled to the players. The screen also serves the purpose of separating the Guide and the Adventurers to create an environment of mystery, and to allow for the Guide to roll dice with ease, privacy, and space.</p>
<h2 id="difficulty-checks">Difficulty Checks<a class="headerlink" href="#difficulty-checks" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The most common mechanic Adventurers will use to overcome obstacles is to perform an a check. Checks are made by rolling 1d20 and adding an ability score modifier to the rolled result. Some rules clearly indicate a minimum result that is required to succeed, but the Guide will often have to decide through improvisation and their own judgment what the threshold for success is dependent on the activity attempted by an Adventurer. This threshold is called a difficulty class (DC), and should be based on the difficulty of the action. The Guide should never reveal the odds of success or failure, and instead only narrate the outcome of the check.  </p>

<p>Hands of Ether uses four ability scores to represent the strengths and weaknesses of a creature’s attributes. Although this simplifies game play, the condensed nature of these scores and their values can be somewhat murky and generalized. To give you an idea of what each ability score represents, and to help you decide which kind of check to instigate during gameplay, here are a few examples of activities and their associated ability checks.

<h2 id="an-adventurers-resources">An Adventurer's Resources<a class="headerlink" href="#an-adventurers-resources" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The Adventurers will overcome many tribulations as they progress that will slowly drain their resources. It is important that the Guide attempts to keep track of two of these dwindling resources during the course of a game session. An Adventurer’s Health and Stamina are their lifeblood in the world of Hands of Ether; they live and die by these two scores in a very literal sense. Unless the Guide wishes to run an especially challenging game, they should aim to stay aware of how much Health and Stamina each Adventurer has remaining.   </p>
<p>If the Adventurers are running low on either of these resources, it may be a good idea to stop issuing any new challenges to them. Provide opportunities for the Adventurers to escape their current situation or find temporary respite. An old tavern in the woods or an abandoned ruin in a cavern can not only give great relief to hurt and tired Adventurers, but also act as opportunities to allow them to have interesting moments of roleplay.  </p>
<h2 id="managing-stamina">Managing Stamina<a class="headerlink" href="#managing-stamina" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Adventurers can lose Stamina from using their abilities
and skills, or as a natural result of performing
adventurous endeavors. Losing Stamina from general
activity, however, should be a rare occurrence.
Stamina should only be lost in this way if an
Adventurer performs an overly strenuous activity, such
as...  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Climbing up a steep vertical cliff for half an hour or more.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lifting an extremely heavy item for an extended amount of time, such as the roof of a collapsing building.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sprinting for half an hour. Carrying a ridiculous amount of weight for a long period of time, such as remaining Encumbered for an entire day.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Halting a stampeding animal through sheer strength alone.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becoming severely cold or hot due to harsh environmental conditions, such as camping without blankets in a tundra, or moving around in a flaming building.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failing to eat or drink for a few days. Rejecting the creeping grasp of sleep for a few days in order to stay on guard against threats in a dark and endless series of unending dungeon corridors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-damage">Understanding Damage<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-damage" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Differing degrees of damage and their associated damage dice can be a confusing concept for a Guide, especially when attempting to determine how much damage a custom creature or weapon should deal to Adventurers. Keep in mind that damage in Hands of Ether is not arbitrary; each point of damage a creature takes represents one cut, one scrape, one laceration. Health in Hands of Ether is literally a creature’s vitality. To take a single point of damage is a dangerous and meaningful blow to a creature. The following is a list of examples to help you understand the correct level of damages to deal to creatures in certain situations.  </p>

<h2 id="challenges-of-adventuring">Challenges of Adventuring<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-of-adventuring" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of hindrances and dangers your Adventurers could face other than combating their enemies. The key to a truly harrowing and challenging adventure is to pit your party against problems as well as enemies.  </p>
<p>The forces of nature itself, for instance, can be more of a challenge than a band of raiders, and can lend your players interesting opportunities to roleplay and get creative. Think outside the box - what could be interesting problems for your Adventurers in the current environment they find themselves in?   </p>
<p>In a jungle filled with insects and boggy water, your Adventurers may contract a disease such as the White Scourge - a supernatural plague that causes a creature to lose twice as much Mana or Stamina as they normally would. Remember to be fair - a Might check against a DC of 10 can be made to fight off a disease trying to take hold.   </p>
<p>In a politically strained town, the Adventurers may have to help the mayor and the merchants resolve their differences before they can buy enough supplies to travel on. Solving social problems with cunning words and successful Wit checks can be just as challenging and rewarding to Adventurers as a fierce battle could be.  </p>
<h2 id="rewards-for-your-adventures">Rewards for Your Adventures<a class="headerlink" href="#rewards-for-your-adventures" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Players are driven by rewards, and Guides will often find joy in granting them. Rewards should always be granted, within narrative reason, to represent the spoils of overcoming adversity in the game. Rewards can also be a valuable tool to push the game’s story forward. Players find satisfaction in a number of diverse ways. Forming a relationship with a favored NPC, opening their own tavern, or saving their hometown from marauders are all examples of narrative rewards. More often than not, however, rewards come in the form of level advancement or discovering new loot.  </p>
<h2 id="level-advancement">Level Advancement<a class="headerlink" href="#level-advancement" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The Guide is free to decide when their Adventurers level up, but it is recommended that they reward Adventurers with advancements in level each time the players successfully overcome an adventuring milestone. Such milestones could be important character development events, successful battles against powerful foes, or the resolution of major conflicts.   </p>
<p>A few felled goblins is no reason to level up an adventuring party. Encountering wild and malevolent creatures should be a day to day occurrence for a typical Adventurer. Level 10 is the suggested maximum level for Adventurers. Therefore, leveling up should be a rare but thrilling occurrence. Make sure to level up Adventurers from a narratively significant, triumphant occasion, such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The party survived a harrowing encounter with a violent and vile gang of criminals. The party has defeated Kragmal the Cruel in combat, saving the quaint village of Snake Run from enslavement.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The party has escaped the labyrinthine crypt. The party has discovered a secret prophecy that threatens all of mortal kind, and have set out from their humble homestead to check the world from this vastly unknown threat.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The party has stopped the wildfire from reaching the secret Moon Temple hidden in the druid’s woodlands. The party survived being stranded on an abandoned island, and has successfully escaped on their makeshift raft.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The party has taken the necromancer’s keep as their own, effectively forming a base of operations and a new home for their adventuring group.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The party has finally ended the threat of civil war by playing an expert game of political manipulation.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, the Guide decides the pace of level advancement. Hands of Ether is structured to be flexible in the amount of time spent playing a campaign. You could impose a level advancement in each session played, or keep the Adventurers at level 1 throughout the entirety of the campaign to maintain a more survivalistic game filled with tension. Hands of Ether runs just as well with a group of level 10 PCs throughout an entire campaign as it does with gradual level advancements throughout an entire campaign.  </p>
<p>Level advancements or the lack thereof can be a powerful tool for the setting and tone of your desired campaign or game. But keep in mind that players as a whole view leveling up as a reward and incentive, and the power to level up should never be completely robbed from them.</p>
<h2 id="narrative-deviation">Narrative Deviation<a class="headerlink" href="#narrative-deviation" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Beyond typical gameplay, there will often come times when the story and the narrative that you have weaved and created with your players takes an unexpected turn. This should be a common occurrence, in fact, as it is always suggested that Guides prepare adversaries and situations rather than premade encounters or plot points.  Hands of Ether offers a number of improvisational narrative tools that the Guide can take advantage of in order to facilitate the circumstances of a free-flowing story.   </p>
<p>For various reasons, an Adventurer in a party may decide to deviate from their group’s path for an extended period of time during the story. If and when such a thing occurs, the Guide and the player must have a session alone and separate from the Rest of the group to determine what the Adventurer does during their separate quest.  </p>
<p>The Guide, in this case, will present the player with narration and scenarios that could span hours, days, or weeks in-game. The Adventurer will describe what they wish to do during these time periods, and will react in a generalized and quickened manner compared to the more small-scope, default style of playing the game.  </p>
<p>The Guide may instigate checks during this time of narrative acceleration, but should do so rarely and sparingly. No dice should be used during a narrative deviation except for 1d20. An Adventurer should have a low chance of harm during a narrative deviation, but should come back from the encounter with something to show for it. Whether it be a magical trinket, a serious injury, or a divine boon, something must be gained during a narrative deviation to reward the Adventurer and player for their time of roleplay. This narrative tool works great for players who have missed a group’s session for one reason or another.</p>
<h2 id="epilogues">Epilogues<a class="headerlink" href="#epilogues" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>When the adventure comes to an end, the Adventurers should sit and discuss with their Guide what they wish for their retired Adventurers to do afterwards. A Cleric may decide to build a temple of their god, whereas a Witch may journey off into the wilderness and become a hermit. These details may affect the world in a future campaign, or may act as a form of closure for the Adventurers after their tale has come to an end. Regardless, it is integral to see where the Adventurers of the story end up, and what their true finality is for the sake of the players, the world, and the story.</p></div>
