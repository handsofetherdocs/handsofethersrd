<p>Welcome to the hands of ether docs! I, Aidan, put these together but it wouldn't have been possible without
the greatest RPG ever made. If you like this game at all, go download the PDF from <a href="https://www.palespine.com/rpgs/">Palespine</a>. Better yet, go buy it off of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Ether-Manual-Zachariah-Gillette/dp/109737209X/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1558081710&amp;refinements=p_27%3AZachariah+Gillette&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2&amp;text=Zachariah+Gillette">Amazon</a>! Enjoy the game!</p>
<hr />
<p>This manual is a tool used to forge stories. People live for stories - we build little ones in our minds, and nurture them into values and tenets. We share them between each other in the moments we feel most human and wild - on winter nights, or huddled away from the rain. When you play this game, you are taking part in the most ancient sort of ritual - a primordial, pure thing.  </p>
<p>It is important, despite the high and sometimes volatile emotions the stories may bring out in you, to follow three principles during the playing of this game. For this ritual to work, each of the storytellers around the table must ‘be on the same page’. Regardless of the other written rules strewn throughout this tome, these three principles are integral to having fun with this game - which is the true goal of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be Honest: This game and its story falters only when a player attempts to shape it into a competition. Lying about rolls, stealing the spotlight, or attempting to be coy or cunning as player instead of as a character will only bring shame and grief in the end. Be honest to yourself, the game, and your fellow players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be Kind: This game works best when played with an open mind and an open heart. Respect each other, and don’t be afraid to take a break if things get heated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listen: Listen closely to what sort of intents and aims the other players are trying to bring into the story. Embrace and expand on other’s ideas, and collaborate with them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How To Play<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-play" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Hands of Ether is an imagination-fueled fantasy game filled with anomalous magic, savage battles, and harrowing quests. The game uses a combination of dice rolls, improvisational storytelling, and pen-and- paper rules to simulate a tale of sword and sorcery. The game has two types of players: the Guide, and the Adventurers.  </p>
<p>The Guide acts as the interpreter and judge of the game’s rules. The Guide presents situations within the world that can be experienced and resolved by the Adventurers. The Guide is also responsible for determining the consequences of the Adventurer’s actions. In addition to maintaining the game’s rules, the Guide also acts as the driving force behind the game’s setting and story. The Guide creates and narrates the atmosphere and details of the game’s world, such as its culture, residents, and dangers. They tell the Adventurers what they are tasting, smelling, hearing, and feeling.  </p>
<p>Each player other than the Guide takes on the role of an Adventurer, which they design themselves. The Adventurers are the main characters of the story. Together, they form a party of Adventurers - a group of characters who work together to overcome challenges, go on quests, and tell their own story within the greater narrative.  </p>
<p>Each Adventurer is unique and individual. To create your own Adventurer’s identity and determine their abilities, follow the instructions in the Character Creation section of this manual. Guides can use the rules throughout this manual to assist them in preparing their setting and story, but must also rely on their own skills of improvisation and imagination to flesh out the details of their fantasy landscape.  </p>
<p>Hands of Ether is best played in person, in an environment free of distractions. To play this game properly, you will need between 4-6 players, including a designated Guide.  </p>
<p>Each Player Needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Pencil.</li>
<li>A Character Sheet.</li>
<li>A set of dice.</li>
<li>A quiet place with a table.</li>
<li>This manual.</li>
<li>Determination.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are new to this game, or new to roleplaying games in general, the following chapter can assist you in understanding some of the core rules used throughout a typical adventure. As a player, however, you are not expected to understand or remember all of these rules perfectly. It is the Guide’s responsibility to understand and enforce the rules of the game. Players are only expected to fulfill their Adventurer’s role in the story, and to embody that Adventurer to the best of their ability.  </p>
<p>Roleplaying can be a difficult concept to understand for those who have never done such a thing before. To put it plainly, roleplaying is essentially ‘playing pretend’. You act and speak as a character you have created inside the fiction of the game’s world.  </p>
<p>As an Adventurer, you control every element of your character. You can speak in their voice, saying what they say. You could also narrate your character’s mannerisms and actions within the world, within reason. Fear not. No one at the table will be offended if your roleplay is lacking, and no one will judge you for your roleplaying in general. Play your character however you would like to. All players of this game should be approaching it with an intent to have fun with and respect the other participants around their table</p>
<h2 id="rolling-dice">Rolling Dice<a class="headerlink" href="#rolling-dice" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Dice are used as a tool to guide the story; to represent the elements of chance and danger throughout the game. Dice rolls are used in various situations, but the nature of each roll will vary. Most rolls will use a twenty-sided die, referred to as a d20. The most common type of dice roll in the game is when an Adventurer makes an ability check. If an Adventurer attempts an action that the Guide considers to have a degree of uncertainty or danger, the Guide can call for that Adventurer to make an ability check.  </p>
<p>Ability checks are made by rolling 1d20 and adding or subtracting an Adventurer’s ability score modifier to the roll’s total. A higher total is a better outcome for the Adventurer’s attempted activity, and a lower total results in a worse outcome. If an Adventurer rolls a 20 on their die, they automatically succeed their check, regardless of their relative ability score modifier. If an Adventurer rolls a 1 on their die, they automatically fail.  </p>
<p>Each ability check made has a target number associated with it, known as a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC represents the difficulty of an endeavor, and is determined by the Guide. Difficult tasks will have a higher DC, and easier tasks will have a lower DC.  </p>
<p>If an Adventurer’s check total meets or exceeds the DC of the check, they succeed in their attempted endeavor. If a check is made and does not meet or exceed the required DC, the Guide determines and narrates the consequences of failure.</p>
<h2 id="exploration">Exploration<a class="headerlink" href="#exploration" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Adventurers can explore the environment described by their Guide at will, within reason. The Adventurer’s exploration of the environment is accomplished by announcing their actions to the Guide. They could declare to the Guide that they are smelling the air or feeling the walls. The Guide, in response, tells the Adventurers what they are experiencing and sensing as a result of their actions. This can help the Guide set the tone, and can help the Adventurers gain useful information about their situation. Exploring the environment may be integral for the Adventurer’s to proceed forward, or could help the Adventurer’s to better understand the story as a whole.  </p>
<p>In addition to their descriptions, the Guide may draw a map of the Adventurer’s current location to act as a visual aid. The Guide is also free to call for ability checks on any exploration activities with a chance of failure, such as Agility checks for picking locks, Might checks for climbing walls, or Wit checks for discovering secret passages.</p>
<h2 id="interacting-with-others">Interacting with Others<a class="headerlink" href="#interacting-with-others" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Throughout an adventure, the Adventurers will interact with different characters and creatures within the fantasy world. The role of these non-player characters (NPCs) are voiced, acted out, and embodied by the Guide. Whenever an Adventurer wishes to engage in conversation with an NPC, the players and the Guide will have a conversation with each other as if their characters were actually speaking to each other.  </p>
<p>If an Adventurer attempts to socially influence an NPC during conversation, that Adventurer must roll a Will check to determine how well they do so and in what manner the NPC reacts to their attempt. If an Adventurer attempts to sense an NPC’s emotions, such as to determine whether or not the NPC is lying to them, the Adventurer must roll a Wit check to determine whether or not they can properly read the NPC’s intent or tone.</p>
<h2 id="combat">Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#combat" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Hands of Ether’s world is rife with conflict. Adventurers will often find themselves engaged in combat against their adversaries. During a round of combat, each Adventurer can perform 2 Actions and move an amount of feet equal to their Speed score. Actions are used to perform any activity other than moving, such as drawing a weapon, drinking a potion, or climbing a wall. Attacking an enemy is the most common Action Adventurers tend to perform during combat. Actions can be used by an Adventurer at any time during a round of combat after their turn has begun.  </p>
<p>Attacking is accomplished by making an attack roll. Attack rolls are made by rolling 1d20 in an attempt to meet or exceed a DC equal to the target’s Defense score. There are no bonuses or penalties applied to an attack roll by default. If an attack roll meets or exceeds this DC, the attack successfully hits and damages the target. Beyond attacking enemies with a weapon, Adventurers may use magical spells or combat skills to attack enemies. Each spell and skill has their own unique effect, which will be detailed in their individual descriptions.</p>
<h2 id="the-world">The World<a class="headerlink" href="#the-world" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Hands of Ether takes place in an outlandish world of crystal-encrusted forests, turbulent spats between dark factions, and valiant battles against ancient, pale giants. There are towns and villages of greatly varying cultures scattered throughout the densely wooded world. It rains more often than the sun deems to shine. A thick and unending sea of fog weaves its way into every nook and hidden rift within the mountain hollows.  </p>
<p>Mysteries are more prevalent than people in this world. While magic is real, it is a rare and fickle force that is barely understood by even the greatest of deities and spirits. There are a sparse few creatures of gifted, chosen, studious, or laboriously disciplined aptitudes that can wield small slivers of magic to limited degrees.
The tools of the world are sturdy and intricate, but still primitive. The technology is on the cusp of mechanical complexity. Items such as telescopes, clocks, and even simplistic firearms exist within the world, albeit as rarities. Technology beyond these limitations are thought of as unknowable alien relics, and exist only in ancient ruins tucked away in forgotten, underground chasms.  </p>
<p>Outside the walls of settlements, a tumultuous landscape of vast and chaotic wilderness reigns. Cavernous crystal corridors connect subterranean ruins to the dens of twisted dragons. Foreboding, muted towers dot the horizon, long forgotten and filled with lurching monsters and peculiar artifacts to be plundered. Creaking, bark-encrusted giants roam the woodlands, mindless and volatile, their branched hair hanging low with intoxicating fruits. Storms of fungal spores sweep over the plains in great waves of neon mist. Vile cults in pale cloaks conspire in city sewers, determined to rectify their dead god.  </p>
<p>But these dark dangers are rare for most. Evil may brew and lurk, but most folk’s lives are quiet and easy. Farms need to be tended, mead must be drank, and tomes must be scoured while the afternoon storm brews and clatters outside. The roads are safe for wandering pilgrims on their way to their family spirit’s far-off shrine, or for caravans of merchants to sell wayward Adventurers oddities from between fur- curtained windows.  </p>
<p>This world’s existence is a quiet one. But sometimes, the pot boils over. This is a world of soft extremes, at the pinnacle of both colorful and dark. When darkness looms in this way, the common folk call for eccentric and noble Adventurers to do away with that evil.  </p>
<h2 id="ether">Ether<a class="headerlink" href="#ether" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The world is fueled by, and made up of, Ether - the unseen, swirling, vibrant, polychromatic fabric of the spiritual world. Every stone, beast, titan, sword, wand, crystal, tree, building, robe, concept, ideal, face, planet, and blade of grass is made up of, or connected to, the Ether. The Ether is the tapestry of souls. All things have their own souls, and all things are, together, one soul.  </p>
<p>Some beings can wield the Ether within themselves, sending it out into the world as a tool or weapon - this is called magic. Some beings can stir and churn the Ether, mixing one thread with another to create a new thread - this is called alchemy. Some beings, such as deities and spirits, are made up of nothing other than Ether. Mortal beings have but a sliver of Ether within them, powering them and connecting them to other sources and forms of Ether. While asleep, mortal beings can sometimes peer into or even alter some of the Ether’s threads - this is known as dreaming.  </p>
<p>Each thread of Ether is independent and individual, but is always part of the greater whole of the tapestry. This means that each being and nonbeing within Hands of Ether is their own kind of Ether - separate from the Ether as a whole, but still connected. Ether is not like our energy - it can be created or destroyed. Ether can wax or wane, shrivel or blossom.</p>
<h2 id="no-fate">No Fate<a class="headerlink" href="#no-fate" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>In Hands of Ether, deities form and are powered by belief. There are hundreds of spirits waxing and waning with the Ether and the faith of mortals. Ether is the, frenetic, physical manifestation of divinity and emotion. Belief and determination are the strongest and purest forms of emotion. Therefore, these two forms of emotion can cause supernatural results as they move and alter the Ether. Belief births, shapes, and powers beings of Ether into existence from nothingness. Determination, however, is another tale.  </p>
<p>This is a world forged by heroes and their determination - those that would toil to mend their ancestor’s mistakes, who would stand against pale giants who seek to slay the world, who would choose their own path, against all odds, and fight until their last breath for their virtues, their family, and most importantly, their choice. There is one deity who does not exist - or rather, who was killed. It’s death was the most integral to shaping this world.  </p>
<p>The heroes of this world slew the god of fate long ago. With its death came the death of infinite threads of Ether it had fabricated in its dark workshop of forced machinations. With its death came choice, hope, freedom, discovery, wonder, curiosity, catastrophe, and anguish, all born into the Ether in a moment swifter than light itself. In this world, there is no fate.</p>
<h2 id="the-story">The Story<a class="headerlink" href="#the-story" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>These are the laws of this world. Throughout this manual, you will find many other hints to this world’s true nature. It is up to the players and their Guide to fill in the gaps of this world’s properties as they play, and to explore their own story within its framework.  </p>
<p>It is suggested, and integral, that each individual playing a role in this game pays close attention to the exact wordings of spells, skills, items, and other such details in this manual in order to determine the exact effects and alterations each of these things have on the world and its story. Each time a spell or skill is used, the Ether, is altered to accommodate those events. The game’s world is ever-changing and ever- adapting. Despite all of this, the players and their Guide’s interpretation of this entire manual is open to discussion and alteration, by the very nature of its existence.</p></div>
