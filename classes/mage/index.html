<p>Some Mages seek power, launching bursts of magical lightning into enemy lines and felling foes with a flick of the wrist. Others wish to manipulate reality; chasing after the secrets of transmutation in an attempt to change the world for the better. Mages are both feared and praised for their ability to wield magical forces to such powerful extents.  </p>
<p>Whether they studied laboriously to gain their power or were gifted with it since birth, Mages use arcane magic to manipulate the world around them. Mages use their mastery of the arcane to bend, shape, control, and alter the fabric of reality itself.  </p>

<p><strong>Cost: 1 Action</strong><br />
Especially attuned to the forces of the arcane, you can
detect, alter, and disrupt magical forces. You can use
this ability a number of times per Rest equal to your
level. Whenever you use this ability, you choose one of
the following effects to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Deflect:</u> You can reflect a spell being cast by a creature within 100 feet of you as a Reaction, gaining control over that spell and using it for yourself. The deflected spell functions as if you were the creature who cast it, but costs you no Mana or Actions. You can only deflect a spell in this way if its Mana cost is equal to or less than your maximum Mana. If the spell you are countering uses an attack roll in order to be cast, you can deflect it whenever it is cast, regardless of whether or not the attack roll is deemed a successful hit or not by the Guide.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Detect:</u> You detect any and all magic within 100 feet of you. The location of any enchantments, active magical effects, or magical traps are revealed to you within range.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Dispel:</u> Any magical effects within 100 feet of you, such as magical traps, items, enchantments, or spells affecting a creature, temporarily cease for 1 minute.  </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mage-skills">Mage Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#mage-skills" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> Once per Rest, you can add 1d4 to the total damage dealt by a harmful spell you have cast as a Free Action.   </p>
<p><strong>Apotropaic.</strong> Exempt from the influence of occult forces, you become immune to being magically Charmed, cursed, or Hexed. You also become immune to the effects of cursed items.   </p>
<p><strong>Cloaked Intent.</strong> Once per Rest, you can weave the Ether to obscure the casting process of a spell you cast. To the untrained eye, your casting process goes entirely unnoticed. A successful Wit check against your spell DC made by another caster reveals to them that you have subtly cast a spell. Otherwise, all creatures within visual range of you are entirely unaware that you are using magic.   </p>
<p><strong>Conjurer.</strong> Once per Rest, you can spend 2 Actions to open up a planar rift to summon forth a creature to aid you. You can summon any 1 companion of your choice. This companion appears in a place of your choice within 50 feet of you, and stays with you as your companion until it dies or until your next Rest ends.   </p>
<p><strong>Contingency Patch.</strong> Once per Rest, you can cast any spell you know and enchant its essence into a cloth patch which melds itself into your clothing. When you use this skill, you designate a condition that triggers the enchanted patch's spell. Whenever this condition occurs within 100 feet of the enchanted patch, the spell within the patch is instantaneously cast as a Reaction. Enchanting a patch in this way costs the same amount of Mana as the spell would normally cost to cast, and the spell's duration and range remain the same, but the casting of the spell occurs as a Reaction. You can only enchant and hold up to 3 of these magical patches at a time.   </p>
<p><strong>Dabbler.</strong> You gain 2 spells of your choice from any other spell lists other than the Mage spell list.   </p>
<p><strong>Diminish.</strong> You have become especially adept at mitigating the potency of magical energies. Once per Rest, you can reduce the damage dealt from a spell to a creature you can see by 1d8 as a Reaction.   </p>
<p><strong>Emendation.</strong> You have become especially careful in controlling the chaotic forces of magical energy. Once per Rest, you can choose to reroll the result of an Arcane Anomaly that occurs within 100 feet of you.   </p>
<p><strong>Empower.</strong> You can spend an amount of Stamina of your choice to temporarily empower the potency of your casting. Your spell DC increases an amount equal to  the  Stamina  you  choose  to  spend.  This improvement to your spell DC lasts for 10 minutes. You can use this skill to increase your spell DC up to a maximum of 20.   </p>
<p><strong>Enchanter.</strong> Once per Rest, you can transfer a spell stored in a scroll to an item of your choice. The item becomes enchanted with the scroll's enchantment, and the used scroll burns into useless ash. The Guide determines the exact details of this enchantment, but should remain open to suggestions.   </p>
<p><strong>Ether Reader.</strong> Whenever you use your Weave to detect magic, intricate esoteric details are revealed to you about the subjects you scan. You learn the class of any spellcasters within range, and you learn the general nature of the enchantments of any items or structures within range.   </p>
<p><strong>Expedite.</strong> You know a technique which allows you to cast magic swiftly. Once per Rest, you can cast a spell you know as a Free Action.   </p>
<p><strong>Erudition.</strong> You permanently gain 2 Mage cantrips of your choice.  </p>
<p><strong>Familiar.</strong> You gain a small animal of your choice as a supernatural companion. You can cast spells through this companion as if you were in the same place as that companion is currently located.   </p>
<p><strong>Fly, You Fools!.</strong> The first time you spend your last use of Weave during an adventuring day, you become Restrained until the beginning of the target's next turn, and each of your allies can each move 50 feet as a Reaction.   </p>
<p><strong>Lucubration.</strong> Once per Rest, you can cast a spell you know that costs 5 Mana for 0 Mana. This ritual costs you 10 Coin and 1 hour of time to perform.   </p>
<p><strong>Mnemonic Storage.</strong> Once per Rest, you can cast a spell and capture its essence within an empty orb which manifests in your hand. This spell has no immediate effect, but the Mana used to cast it is spent as normal. This spell can then be cast the next day as a Free Action, without the use of Mana. All other attributes of this stored spell, such as its range and duration, are used as they would normally be used whenever you activate the orb.   </p>
<p><strong>Pilfer.</strong> Your understanding of magic and its energies have become almost intuitive. Whenever you are targeted by an enemy's spell, you can choose to roll a Wit check as a Reaction against a DC of 20 in an attempt to understand the spell. On a success, you immediately and permanently gain that spell. You can gain new spells in this way past your default maximum amount of known spells.   </p>
<p><strong>Pocket Realm.</strong> You have the ability to access a portal that leads to a small, enclosed realm. This pocket realm can only be accessed by you, and can hold up to 10 Bulk worth of items inside of it.   </p>
