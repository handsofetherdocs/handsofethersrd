<h1 id="warrior">Warrior<a class="headerlink" href="#warrior" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Whether they are grizzled mercenaries or flamboyant gladiators, Warriors are combatants that use tactical maneuvers and a mastery over their weapons to further their goals. Often acting as the battle-hardened enforcer to their tenets and the virtues of their allies, the life of a Warrior is a path of uncertainty and savagery.  </p>
<h3 id="primary-ability-score">Primary Ability Score<a class="headerlink" href="#primary-ability-score" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Might.</p>
<h2 id="primary-ability-surge">Primary Ability: <strong>Surge</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#primary-ability-surge" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>

<p><strong>Commander.</strong> You can spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to issue a command to an unrestrained ally of your choice who can hear you. The ally can then move a distance up to their Speed and make an attack roll as a Reaction to your command, even if they have already moved their maximum Speed during the same round.   </p>
<p><strong>Cut First Turf.</strong> Your allies look to you for motivation on the battlefield. Once per Rest, you can yell out a battle cry which riles up all allies who can hear you. Each of these allies gain 1 additional Action during their first turn in the combat encounter.   </p>
