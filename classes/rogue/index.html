<h1 id="rogue">Rogue<a class="headerlink" href="#rogue" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Some Rogues are nimble thieves or stealthy assassins, slinking through shadows and leaping across rooftops in pursuit of ill-gotten gains. Others use their criminal connections and cunning to further their goals, and prowl the dark reaches of city underbellies to gamble, smuggle, and grift the unknowing populace. Whatever their motivations, Rogues specialize in trickery, deceit, and discretion. Rogues  excel  at  finding  and  exploiting  the vulnerabilities of others, inside and outside of combat.</p>

<h2 id="primary-ability-hinder">Primary Ability: <strong>Hinder</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#primary-ability-hinder" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Cost: 1 Action</strong><br />
Once per round, you can make a subtle and exploitive attack against an unaware foe to disable them. This cunning strike is called a Hinder. To Hinder a target, that target must either be unaware of your presence or within 5 feet of one of your allies. Make an attack roll. On a hit, your attack deals damage as normal as well as an additional 1d4 damage. You can then choose to target a specific part of the target’s body to disable them in some capacity. Choose one of the following options to affect the target whenever you attempt to Hinder.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Trauma:</u> A successful Hinder aimed at a creature’s head causes that target to become Stunned until the beginning of the next round.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Stagger:</u> A successful Hinder aimed at a creature’s torso causes that target to become Sapped until the beginning of the next round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Disarm:</u> A successful Hinder aimed at a creature’s arms forces the target to drop an item that they are holding as a Reaction. You choose which item the target drops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Subdue:</u> A successful Hinder aimed at a creature’s legs causes that target to become Encumbered until the beginning of the next round.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Agitator.</strong> Whenever an enemy misses you with an attack roll, an ally of your choice within 50 feet can make an attack roll against that enemy as a Reaction, as long as that ally is within range to attack that enemy.   </p>
<p><strong>Ambusher.</strong> Whenever a surprise round occurs with your party as the ones who are surprising your enemies, you can perform two Actions instead of just one.   </p>
<p><strong>Ankle Slicer.</strong> You make attack rolls with advantage against any creatures that are one or more sizes larger than you.   </p>
<p><strong>Arcane Trickster.</strong> You gain proficiency in artifacts. You also gain 2 Mage spells of your choice which cost 3 Mana or less and 2 Bard spells of your choice which cost 3 Mana or less. You can cast each of these spells once per Rest.   </p>
<p><strong>Assassinate.</strong> If you Hinder a creature who has not yet had a turn in combat and has less maximum Health than you, that target dies instantly.   </p>
<p><strong>Backstabber.</strong> Whenever an enemy moves out of melee range of you, you can make an attack roll against that enemy as a Reaction.   </p>
<p><strong>Counter Strike.</strong> Whenever an enemy misses you with an attack roll, you can spend 2 Stamina to make an attack roll against that enemy as a Reaction.   </p>
<p><strong>Covert.</strong> You have trained yourself to move and act in a particularly discrete manner. You roll with advantage on Agility checks to hide, move stealthily, or remain hidden.   </p>
<p><strong>Criminal Contact.</strong> You gain an underground contact who can keep you informed of important people and events. You determine the lineage, class, and affiliation of your contact. The Guide determines your contact's name, demeanor, and personality. This connection can give you valuable information and do simple tasks for you if instructed to. If instructed to perform a task that puts them in harm's way, your contact must be persuaded with a successful Will check in order to cooperate.   </p>
<p><strong>Closed Casket.</strong> Whenever you make an attack roll that results in a critical hit, that attack automatically becomes a Hinder as a Reaction.

<p><strong>Deceiver.</strong> You roll with advantage on Will checks made to deceive, trick, or lie to other humanoid creatures.   </p>
<p><strong>Demolitionist.</strong> You have been trained to create explosive implements, and to handle those explosives effectively. Once per Rest, you can craft 1 bomb.

This detonation causes a structure that is 10 Bulk or less and is within your default melee range to become Broken.   </p>
<p><strong>Dexterous.</strong> You are agile and cunning in your movements. Your Agility increases by 3, to a maximum of 18.   </p>
<p><strong>Dirty Trick.</strong> Improvisational and lacking moral fiber, you can perform a number of nasty combat maneuvers to hinder your enemies. Once per round, you can perform your choice of any of the following tricks as a Free Action.   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Now You See Me:</u> You kick loose debris into an enemy's eyes. Make an attack roll against a creature within your default melee range. On a hit, the target becomes Blinded until they spend 1 Action to rub the dirt from their eyes. Have a Nice  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Trip:</u> You scoop the legs out from underneath your opponent. Make an attack roll against a creature within your default melee range. On a hit, the target becomes Prone. You Won't Be Needing  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>This:</u> You attempt to rip an item from your enemy's grasp. You and an enemy of your choice within your default melee range each make a Might check. If your total result is higher than the target's total result, the target's currently held item becomes your currently held item. You can only use this trick if you have one hand free and unoccupied. You Look a Bit Tied  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Up:</u> Make an Agility check against a DC of 10. On a success, you quickly tie up the feet of a creature of your choice within your default melee range. You do this in a manner of your choosing, such as tying their boot strings together. The target becomes Encumbered until they spend 1 Action to release themselves.   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disruptive.</strong> Whenever an enemy casts a spell within your attack roll range, you can make an attack roll against that enemy as a Reaction. If this attack roll hits, that enemy becomes Stunned until the beginning of your next turn, and the spell they were attempting to cast falters and fails.   </p>
<p><strong>Evasive.</strong> Especially dexterous, you roll with advantage on Agility checks made to dodge out of harm's way, such as dodging spell effects or triggered traps.   </p>
<p><strong>Fast Hands.</strong> Once per round, you can manipulate an item as a Free Action. You can draw or stow an item, manipulate an item or device within your default melee range, activate an item, or use an item on yourself.   </p>
