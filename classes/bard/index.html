<h1 id="bard">Bard<a class="headerlink" href="#bard" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Bards are charismatic spell casters who use expression and art to bolster and inspire their allies. Their magic is empowered by the forces of creation and emotion. Bards could be prolific artists, cunning manipulators, dabblers of psychic forces, or inspiring leaders.  </p>

<p>Will.</p>
<h2 id="primary-ability-inspire">Primary Ability: <strong>Inspire</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#primary-ability-inspire" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Cost: 1 Action</strong><br />
You can empower your allies with bursts of magical motivation. You can grant an ally who can hear you a d6, called an Inspire die. Once within the next 10 minutes, the Inspired ally can roll their Inspire die as a Reaction and add the rolled result as a bonus to their choice of any ability check they make. Once an Inspire die is rolled, it is used and lost. An ally can only hold one Inspire die at a time. Inspire die granted to an ally disappear on their own after 10 minutes have passed.  </p>
<p>You can use this ability a number of times per Rest equal to your level.</p>

<p><strong>Ardent.</strong> Exceptionally motivational, your inspiration die become d8.   </p>
<p><strong>Awen.</strong> An agent of the ancient way, you uphold the forgotten virtues of spoken word. Using the magic hidden within phonetic expressions of chants and mantras, you can perform a number of bardic feats. Forest’s Word, Forest  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Sword:</u> You twist roots and rhymes around a branch you have collected. The branch becomes a sword of wood. A crystal centers itself into the hilt, climbing out of the wood’s grains. The sword is dull when you wish it to be, and sharp when it needs to be. You are considered proficient with this sword, even if you lack melee proficiency. On a hit, the sword deals 1d6 damage + your Will score modifier, and the target must succeed a Will check against a DC of 10 or begin to suffer from dark hallucinations of the forest’s wrath. Golden  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Fern:</u> Your words spill forth over the leaflets of a fern you have collected, encasing it in Ether. The fern shines like both blood and gold. You can place this golden fern on the brow of an ally. That ally becomes immune to poisons and toxins until their next Rest. In addition, that ally becomes Stabilized as a Reaction whenever they first fall Unconscious before their next Rest. Wind  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Word:</u> You can shout into the Ether to send a message. Your words ride the Ether, and arrive in the wind near their destination. These words can cause fear in your enemies, joy in your allies, or beseech more powerful beings for help in times of need. Your words are purest and loudest when they are desperate. Otherwise, there is a limited degree of failure to this bardic ritual.   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Battle Cry.</strong> Once per Rest, as a Reaction to initiative being rolled, you can belt out an uproarious battle song that grants each ally of yours who can hear you 1 additional Action during the first round of a combat encounter.   </p>
<p><strong>Boast.</strong> You can Inspire yourself.   </p>
<p><strong>Charismatic.</strong> You add both your Will and Wit score modifiers to any Will check you make to interact socially with other creatures.   </p>
<p><strong>Concussive.</strong> Each time you hit an enemy with an attack roll from a spell, the target of that spell becomes disoriented and must make all of their attack rolls with disadvantage until the beginning of the target's next turn.   </p>
<p><strong>Dancer.</strong> Graceful in your movements, you can tumble and dive out of harm’s way. As a Reaction, you can spend 2 Stamina to reduce damage you take from a fall or attack roll by an amount equal to 1d4 + your Agility score modifier.   </p>
<p><strong>Diplomat.</strong> You roll with advantage whenever you make a Will check in an attempt to appease, comfort, or politically influence another humanoid creature.   </p>
<p><strong>Encore.</strong> You regain 1 Inspire die each time you reduce an enemy to 0 Health.   </p>
<p><strong>Face.</strong> Always eager to act as your allies’ envoy, you gain an edge when negotiating or speaking for the whole of your party. Whenever you speak as the mouthpiece of your allies under situations of social pressure, such as negotiating the price of something your group is buying or pleading your group’s case in a court, you can add each of your group’s Will score modifiers to your total Will check result.   </p>
<p><strong>Flight of the Flop.</strong> The first time your inspire die are reduced to 0 during an adventuring day, you can move 50 feet as a Reaction.   </p>
<p><strong>Foreboding Aura.</strong> Once per Rest, you can take on an air of power and intimidation, striking fear and apprehension into the hearts of your enemies. For 1 minute, enemies that attempt to make an attack roll against you must first succeed a Will check against your spell DC. On a failure, that enemy cannot make an attack roll against you and loses 1 Action due to their hesitation. On a success, that enemy makes an attack roll against you as normal, and does not suffer from any ill effects.   </p>
<p><strong>Iron Verse.</strong> Once per Rest, you can add a Defense bonus to an ally equal to 1d4 until that ally’s next Rest.   </p>
<p><strong>Jester.</strong> Playfully malicious and deceptive, you can perform a number of harmful magical tricks to hinder your enemies. You can spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to perform any of the following enchanted routines.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Insult:</u> You demoralize an enemy. An enemy of your choice who can hear you must reduce the total result of their next ability check by 1d4.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Prank:</u> You cause an enemy who can hear you to be filled with uncontrollable glee. The target’s Defense is reduced by 1d4 until the beginning of the target's next turn.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Taunt:</u> You shout out enchanted insults to a creature of your choice who can hear you. The target becomes stricken with a supernatural rage, unable to focus on anything other than you. The target cannot attack any creatures other than you until the combat encounter ends or you become Unconscious.   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lift the Spirits.</strong> Once per Rest, you can spend 10 minutes of time and 1 inspire die to fill your comrade’s hearts  and  minds  with  a  renewed  sense  of determination and rejuvenation. Up to four allies of your choice gain the benefits of a Rest.   </p>
<p><strong>Many Voices.</strong> You are especially talented when it comes to impersonations. You can perfectly mimic any voice or noise you have heard before.   </p>
<p><strong>Minstrel.</strong> You roll with advantage on all Will checks made to perform your art form. Additionally, you can spend 2 Stamina to perform your art form while in front of a crowd to gain 1d10 Coin. All members of an audience you perform for in this way become Charmed by you for 10 minutes after your performance.   </p>
<p><strong>Muse.</strong> You draw your creative magic from a particular metaphysical source. Choose one of the following Muses to benefit from. Your choice of Muse is permanent.  </p>

Once per Rest, you can cast 1 spell you know after performing your chosen art form in front of a crowd of ten or more creatures for at least 10 minutes. If the audience is entertained or enthralled in some way, the casting of this spell costs you no Mana.   </p>

<p><strong>Turn the Tide.</strong> Once per Rest, you can create a 50 foot radius aura around yourself made up of wind, light, and sound. This aura’s area of effect is centered on you, and moves with you whenever you move. Any allies within the aura regain 1d4 Health as a Reaction whenever they take damage. Any ranged attack rolls made against allies inside the aura by enemies outside of the aura are made with disadvantage. This aura’s effects last until the end of the current combat encounter or until you become Unconscious.</p>
