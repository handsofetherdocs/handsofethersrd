<h1 id="witch">Witch<a class="headerlink" href="#witch" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Witches draw their magic from both the primal energies of nature as well as the eldritch traditions of the occult. Their power is not learned or harnessed, but is instead bargained for. Each Witch gains their power from an otherworldly being or spirit in exchange for either their servitude, soul, or an oath of some sort.  </p>
<p>Most of these patrons are innately tied to either the world of shadow or the world of nature, and the Witch’s powers reflect that. Their spells are manifestations of nature and the darkness within it. Witches use their magic to maim and curse their foes, and are often plagued by suspicion and misunderstanding from others.</p>

<p>Will.</p>
<h2 id="primary-ability-hex">Primary Ability: <strong>Hex</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#primary-ability-hex" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Cost: 1 Action</strong><br />
You send esoteric energies towards a creature of your choice who you can see. The target becomes Hexed until the end of your next turn. The Hex reduces the target’s amount of Actions by 1. Your Hex can only affect one creature at a time.  </p>
<p>The effects of a Hex remain until you Hex a new target or until you become Unconscious.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Bestial Alteration.</strong> Once per Rest, you can magically mutate the form of up to five creatures of your choice in a minor way which mimics a beast of nature. You could form gills and webbed hands on the targets to assist them while maneuvering underwater, or make fur sprout from their skin to protect them from arctic weather.   </p>
<p><strong>Bound Weapon.</strong> You have the ability to magically bond to a weapon of your choice. It costs you 3 Stamina and 1 hour of time to form this spiritual connection to a new weapon. Once bound to a weapon in this way, you can cause the weapon to vanish or reappear as a Free Action. If the weapon is taken from your hand, it automatically teleports back into your grasp as a Reaction. If the weapon is a ranged weapon, such as a bow, you can reload it as a Free Action. You can only have one bound weapon at a time.   </p>
<p><strong>Commune.</strong> Once per Rest, you can fall into a trance to commune with nearby spirits, ghosts, and phantoms in the surrounding area. You can ask the spirits up to three questions about the area. The answers you receive are always truthful, but may be one-worded and vague.   </p>
<p><strong>Cloak of Shadow.</strong> Once per Rest, you can weave the dark powers of the shadow realm around your form to become Invisible for up to 1 hour.   </p>
<p><strong>Crimson Rite.</strong> Once per Rest, you can place a drop of fresh blood from a creature on your forehead and fall into a trance of divination. During this trance, you are given vague imagery and words that reveal properties of the creature, such as their occupation, emotions, memories, loves, history, greatest fears, or highest ambitions.   </p>
<p><strong>Curse Monger.</strong> Whenever you Hex an enemy, you can choose to cause an additional enemy of your choice to become Hexed as well. As long as the initial target remains Hexed, the additional target also remains Hexed.   </p>
<p><strong>Devious Transference.</strong> Once per Rest, you can perform an eldritch rite which exchanges your life force with another creature's. Choose a creature you can see. The target's current Health and your current Health are exchanged. If the target's current Health exceeds your maximum Health, you gain no additional Health past your maximum Health threshold when using this skill.   </p>
<p><strong>Devour Essence.</strong> Once per Rest, you can draw energy from the wilderness to recharge your dark magic. Choose one animal or one 50 foot radius area of wilderness to drain the energy from and regain 1d10 Mana. If an animal is targeted with this skill, that animal dies and cannot be resurrected. If an area is targeted with this power, all vegetation in the area wilts and dies, becoming a permanent scar on the landscape.   </p>
<p><strong>Eldritch Invocation.</strong> You can draw power from your patron to temporarily enhance your abilities. After each Rest, choose one of the following benefits to gain until your next Rest. Whenever you choose a new invocation, the effects of your former invocation end.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Shell:</u> Your default Defense increases by 1.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Wing:</u> Your Speed increases by 10.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Blood:</u> Your maximum Health increases by 1d4.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Eye:</u> You can see perfectly in darkness out to a range of 50 feet as if the area was not obscured.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Claw:</u> Attack rolls made by you deal an additional 1d4 damage on a hit.   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Elemental Affinity.</strong> You are adept at wielding the power of the natural elements. You roll with advantage on all attack rolls made with cantrips, spells or weapons that inflict elemental damage.   </p>
<p><strong>Elemental Infusal.</strong> Once per Rest, you can infuse a weapon with the power of a natural element. Choose either water and ice, fire, or electricity. The affected weapon's damage type is transformed into the chosen elemental damage type until your next Rest.   </p>
<p><strong>Enthrall.</strong> You can spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to bring one animal or one lesser undead creature under your thrall. The target must succeed a Will check against your spell DC or become your companion until your next Rest.   </p>
<p><strong>Esoteric Emendation.</strong> Your understanding of the dark arts is extensive. You gain an additional 2 Witch spells of your choice.   </p>
<p><strong>Flame Wreath.</strong> As a Free Action, you can spend 3 Stamina to summon a circle of fire around yourself in a 10 foot radius. This fire cannot harm you or your allies, but any enemies who begin their turn inside of the fire takes 1d4 damage. While this flaming ring is summoned, you can spend 1 Action to launch a ball of fire from this ring. Make an attack roll against an enemy of your choice who you can see. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 damage. At the beginning of your subsequent turns, you can choose to spend 2 Stamina in order to maintain this fire and its effects. Otherwise, this fire disappears at the end of the round in which it was summoned.   </p>
<p><strong>Forbidden Exchange.</strong> You make a pact with a spirit or entity in order to sacrifice your vitality and energies in exchange for magical power. You gain 3 Witch spells of your choice and your maximum Stamina permanently decreases by 5.   </p>
<p><strong>Frenetic Intervention.</strong> Once per Rest, your patron will come to your aid in some way. The Guide determines the exact details and timing of this helpful supernatural event.   </p>
<p><strong>Insidious Hex.</strong> Your cursing magic is especially potent. Your Hex decreases a target's Actions by 2 instead of 1.   </p>
<p><strong>Infernal Healing.</strong> You can draw vitality out of the blood of an enemy you have slain using a chaotic and dangerous ritual. You can spend 2 Actions to apply the blood of a recently slain creature to your body to regain 1d8 Health. On a roll of 1, you regain no Health and instead become Corrupted.   </p>
<p><strong>Lunar Blessing.</strong> While outside at night, all spells cast by you cost 1 less Mana than they would normally cost.   </p>
