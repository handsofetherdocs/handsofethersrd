<p>Clerics are devout followers of a metaphysical force who use divine power to further their goals and protect the tenets of a certain religious order or spiritual philosophy. These priests use their sacred magic to bless their allies and curse their enemies. Clerical magic is diverse and potent, but most Clerics are not above defending their tenets with sword and shield as well as vestments and verses.</p>

<p><strong>Bountiful Blessings.</strong> Whenever you use your Bless ability and you roll the maximum possible result on any of the bless die you roll, you can roll 1 additional die and add it to the total result your Bless ability’s healing.   </p>
<p><strong>Call to Arms.</strong> Once per Rest, as a Reaction to the beginning of a combat encounter, you can call upon your heavenly patron’s wrath. The air is shattered with the sounds of a heavenly call to war, filling the hearts of your enemies with fear and doubt. The banging of distant war drums can be heard - the sound of your deity’s forces riling to aid you in battle. Any enemies who can hear you roll initiative at disadvantage.   </p>
<p><strong>Celestial Incantation.</strong> Once per Rest, you can call upon your deity in order to cast a spell beyond your typical capabilities. After each Rest, make a Will check against a DC of 10. On a success, your patron hears your call and grants you the ability to cast any 1 spell of your choice from the Cleric spell list before your next Rest. You can cast this spell once before your next Rest, and doing so costs you no Mana.   </p>
<p><strong>Cleanser.</strong> Once per Rest, you can remove a curse or Corruption from an item or creature of your choice.   </p>

<p><strong>Conqueror’s Blessing.</strong> Once per Rest, you can enchant a weapon of your choice with sacred power. This blessed weapon gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with it, and damage dealt by it is considered magical and holy. These effects last until your next Rest.   </p>

<p><strong>Cure Wounds.</strong> You can spend 1 Action and 1 divine die in order to cure an ally of a Wound.   </p>
<p><strong>Divine Sense.</strong> You are able to detect the presence of certain creatures using your divine senses. Once per Rest, you can sense for your choice of either evil or good creatures within 1 mile of you. If such a presence is revealed to you by using this skill, you learn what kind of creature it is, how many of them there are, and their general location.   </p>
<p><strong>Diabolical.</strong> Drawing your power from demonic energies, you gain 1 Witch spell of your choice. In addition, you gain an imp as a companion.   </p>
<p><strong>Diviner.</strong> Once per Rest, you can reach out to your deity or your deity’s sacred servants to receive mystical answers concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within the following week. To do so, you must be in a place related to your deity, and you must present an offering. The greater your offering, the clearer the answer to your questioning prayer will be.   </p>
<p><strong>Doomsayer.</strong> You can spend 2 Stamina to belt out a sermon of dread and apocalyptic musings as a Free Action. An enemy of your choice who you can see must make attack rolls and Will checks with disadvantage until the beginning of the target's next turn.   </p>
<p><strong>Enlightened.</strong> The maximum amount of bless die you have access to per day becomes equal to your level + your Will score modifier.   </p>
<p><strong>Exorcist.</strong> You are trained in the priestly art of exorcism. You are able to automatically determine whether or not a creature is possessed, as well as what sort of entity is possessing them. You can then expunge any spirit or being that is possessing another creature with a successful Will check against a DC of 10. On a success, the possessing entity is banished from their host and flees to another realm. On a result of a natural 1, the possessing entity is purged from its current host and possesses you instead. If this occurs, you gain the Possessed condition from the Corruption table. On a roll of 20, the possessing entity is expunged from their host and permanently destroyed.   </p>
<p><strong>Eyes of the Grave.</strong> Once per Rest, you can sense for creatures or items within 500 feet of you that have been touched by death or undeath. Any undead creatures, dead bodies, necromantic spell casters, or necromancy-related items are revealed to you and are outlined in a faint aura that only you can see.   </p>
<p><strong>Grave Guardian.</strong> Whenever an ally you can see falls Unconscious, that ally becomes Stabilized as a Reaction.   </p>
<p><strong>Harbinger.</strong> Once per Rest, you can preach a sermon to announce the coming of your deity’s power, fury, and might as a Free Action. Any enemies who can hear you become afraid of you, and roll with disadvantage on attack rolls against you until their next Rest.   </p>
<p><strong>Holy Blood.</strong> Your divine energy shelters you from disease and poisons. You become immune to the Sapped condition, and you can no longer become diseased or poisoned.   </p>
