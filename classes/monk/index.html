<p>Whether they are self-taught hermits or have learned their fighting techniques from a prestigious monastery, Monks have trained their bodies into honed tools of power,  speed,  and  control.  These  disciplined combatants use a series of intricate martial maneuvers to harm and hinder their opponents.  </p>
<h3 id="primary-ability-score">Primary Ability Score<a class="headerlink" href="#primary-ability-score" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Agility.</p>
<h2 id="primary-ability-strike">Primary Ability: <strong>Strike</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#primary-ability-strike" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Cost: 1 Action</strong><br />
A Monk is never unarmed. Using a series of disciplined physical techniques, Monks can cause harm to their enemies with specialized unarmed strikes. You deal 1d6 damage on a successful unarmed attack roll. This damage increases to 1d8 whenever you reach level 5.</p>

<h2 id="monk-skills">Monk Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#monk-skills" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bloody Menace.</strong> While harmed, others find your presence more intimidating than disarming. If your current Health is equal to or lower than half of your maximum Health, enemies must make a Will check against a DC equal to your Will score whenever you attempt to attack them with a Strike. If they fail, you gain advantage on your Strike attack rolls against them until the end of the encounter.   </p>
<p><strong>Catch and Release.</strong> Adept at catching and deflecting projectiles, you can spend 2 Stamina as a Reaction to reduce damage from a ranged attack roll that has hit you by 1d8. If you successfully reduce the damage from a caught projectile to 0, you can then make a ranged attack roll with it against an enemy of your choice within 100 feet of you as a Reaction. This deflected attack is considered a Strike despite its range.   </p>
<p><strong>Disarm.</strong> You can spend 1 Action in an attempt to disarm an enemy within your melee range. The target must succeed a Might check against a DC of 10 or have their currently wielded item or weapon torn from their grasp and thrown 10 feet away from them in a direction of your choice.   </p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Senses.</strong> While Blinded, your heightened sense of awareness allows you to make attack rolls normally instead of at disadvantage.   </p>
<p><strong>Firm Grip.</strong> Your hands lock into place when grasping items or weapons. You cannot become disarmed by another creature's use of disarming skills or spells. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to all Might checks you make in an attempt to maintain your grip on an item or structure.   </p>
<p><strong>Flurry of Blows.</strong> You can spend 2 Stamina to release a flurry of strikes against an enemy within your default melee range as a Free Action. You make a number of Strike attack rolls against the target equal to 1 + your Agility score modifier.   </p>
<p><strong>Ground and Center.</strong> You can take a moment to steady your breath and center yourself, performing a physical rite which supernaturally rejects negative energy or physical ailments. You can spend 2 Stamina to cure yourself of either the Stunned, Blinded, or Sapped condition as a Free Action.   </p>
<p><strong>Guarded Stance.</strong> You can spend 2 Stamina to adopt an especially defensive battle stance as a Free Action. You become Covered until the beginning of your next turn.   </p>
<p><strong>Grapple.</strong> You can physically restrain enemies using a series of intricate grapples and holds. You can spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to grapple a creature no larger than yourself within 5 feet of you. The target becomes Restrained until you choose to release them as a Free Action, and automatically moves with you whenever you move. This maneuver occupies one of your hands.   </p>
<p><strong>Herding Maneuver.</strong> You can forcefully shove a target with such strength that they are flung backwards. You can spend 2 Stamina to move a creature within your default melee range 10 feet in a direction of your choice as a Free Action.   </p>
<p><strong>Tree Stance.</strong> You can focus your physical energy to lift heavy items or structures to a supernatural extent. You can spend 2 Stamina in order to lift up to three times your Bulk for up to 1 minute as a Free Action.   </p>
<p><strong>Iron Skin.</strong> Rigorous training has hardened your physical form in order to supernaturally withstand attacks. Your Defense permanently increases by 1, to a maximum of 18.   </p>
<p><strong>Kip Up.</strong> During your turn, you can end the Prone condition on yourself as a Free Action.   </p>
<p><strong>Mad Dasher.</strong> You are able to move in powerful bursts in order to cover more ground than typical. You can spend 2 Stamina to move double your maximum Speed as a Free Action on your turn. You can only do so once per round.   </p>
<p><strong>Mage Slayer.</strong> You are trained to dispatch spell casters. Whenever an enemy attempts to cast a spell within melee range of you, you can make an attack roll against that enemy as a Reaction. In addition, you make ability checks with advantage to avoid spell effects from enemy casters within 10 feet of you.   </p>
<p><strong>Unerring Striker.</strong> Your technique in martial combat is adept. You never make a fatal mistake on the battlefield. Whenever you roll a natural 1 on a Strike, you can reroll.   </p>
<p><strong>Meditate.</strong> Once per Rest, you can meditate for one hour to draw new Ether into your physical body, regaining 1d8 Health and 1d8 Stamina.   </p>
<p><strong>Move Like Water.</strong> You can spend 2 Stamina to avoid an attack roll made against you that would otherwise hit, making that attack roll automatically miss as a Reaction.   </p>
<p><strong>Open Palm.</strong> You use an intricate technique in an attempt to lock an enemy's muscles into place. You spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to make a Strike attack roll against a creature within your melee range. On a hit, the target takes damage as normal and becomes Stunned until the beginning of your next turn.   </p>
<p><strong>Opportunist.</strong> Whenever you hit with an attack roll against an enemy that is Stunned or Blinded, your attack automatically becomes a critical hit.   </p>
<p><strong>Pugilist.</strong> You add your Might score modifier as a bonus to the damage you deal with your Strikes.   </p>
<p><strong>Rare Form.</strong> You add your Agility score modifier as a bonus to all attack rolls you make with your Strikes.   </p>
<p><strong>Silent Strider.</strong> Your footfalls are completely silent, and your every move is careful and calculated. You make no noise while running, walking, climbing, or jumping. Any Agility check you make in an attempt to move, jump, or climb stealthily which results in a roll of 9 or lower instead automatically becomes a result of 10 + your Agility score modifier.   </p>
<p><strong>Slow Fall.</strong> You can channel your spiritual energy into an aura that slows your fall and cushions your landing. You spend 2 Stamina as a Reaction to falling in order to reduce the damage taken from that fall an amount equal to 1d6 + your Agility score modifier.   </p>
<p><strong>Soaring Leap.</strong> You can spend 2 Stamina to jump up to 20 feet vertically or horizontally as a Free Action, landing perfectly and taking no damage from your fall.   </p>
<p><strong>Spell Dodger.</strong> If an enemy makes an attack roll against you using a spell, you can spend 2 Stamina as a Reaction to cause that attack roll to be made with disadvantage.   </p>
<p><strong>Spry.</strong> Your maximum Stamina becomes equal to your Agility score.   </p>
<p><strong>Stone Fist.</strong> Your training utilizes a heavy-handed approach, using your center of mass to slam into opponents with hefty blows. You can spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to make a powerful, weighty Strike against a creature within your melee range. On a hit, the target takes damage as normal and becomes Sapped and Restrained until the beginning of the target's next turn.   </p>
<p><strong>Sweeping Strike.</strong> You perform a maneuver to falter an opponent's foundation. You can spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to perform this toppling kick on an enemy within melee range of you. Make a Strike attack roll against a creature within your melee range. On a hit, the target takes damage as normal and becomes Prone.   </p>
<p><strong>Tracer.</strong> You can leap over a gap, jump upwards, and climb over structures during combat as Free Actions. In addition, you roll with advantage on all Agility and Might checks made to jump and climb.   </p>
<p><strong>Twin Serpent Strike.</strong> Whenever you successfully reduce an enemy to 0 Health using a Strike, you can make 1 additional Strike attack roll against another enemy within your default melee range as a Free Action.   </p>
<p><strong>Wall Skip.</strong> Whenever an enemy misses an attack roll against you and you are within 10 feet of a wall or structure, you can attempt to retreat from that enemy as a Reaction. To do so, you must succeed an Agility check against a DC of 10. On a failure, you do not move and instead become Prone. On a success, you move up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice. If you land in a new place within melee range of another enemy, you can make an attack roll against that enemy as a Reaction.  </p></div>
