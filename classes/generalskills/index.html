<p>General skills are skills which any Adventurer can take in place of a class skill. They consist of talents or techniques which Adventurers from all walks of life can learn or commit to. An Adventurer’s skill list could contain no general skills, a few, or be entirely comprised of them.</p>
<p><strong>Artisan.</strong> Once per Rest, you can fabricate your choice of either 1 potion, 1 trinket, 1d12 pieces of ammunition, 1 set of armor, 1 shield, or 1 weapon. In addition, you can cure the Broken condition on 1 nonmagical item once per Rest. You require no ingredients, tools, or materials to fabricate an item using this skill other than a fabrication kit.   </p>
<p><strong>Chef.</strong> You have become adept at preparing hardy, palatable meals. You must have a wild kit to do so. Once per Rest, you can spend 10 minutes of time to create 5 rations.   </p>
<p><strong>Clay Wielder.</strong> You can manipulate and wield a supernatural clay to perform esoteric feats. You can perform any of the following feats. Performing each of these tricks costs you 1 Action and 2 Stamina.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Commune:</u> You can ask the clay for guidance. You cast the Augury cantrip.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Launch:</u> You can launch a small sphere of clay as a projectile towards an enemy you can see. Make an attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 damage.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Seal:</u> You can smear the clay on an ally to seal their injuries. The target regains 1d4 Health, and their Bleeding is cured.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Shell:</u> You can smear the clay on an ally and harden it into a protective shell. The target’s default Defense increases by 2 until that target takes damage.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Wall:</u> You can create a wall of clay in a 5 foot radius area of your choice which you can see. A creature behind this wall becomes Covered.   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coward.</strong> You can choose to retract in fear whenever there is a threat of death, sacrificing an ally of yours to become a victim instead. If a successful attack roll against you would decrease your Health to 0, you can choose for that attack to hit an ally of your choice instead as a Reaction. The ally you divert this attack to must be within 10 feet of you. The chosen ally takes the damage instead of you.   </p>
<p><strong>Dark Wager.</strong> You make a deal with a spirit from below the Ether. This pact magic comes to you for a price. You gain 4 Witch spells of your choice. The spells you chose must cost 2 Mana or less. If you are not a caster, you can cast each of these spells once per Rest. You pay the price of this eldritch boon with you own vitality. Your maximum Health is reduced by 2d8, to a minimum of 1.   </p>
<p><strong>Defensive.</strong> Your default Defense permanently increases by 1, and you gain proficiency in both shields and armor.   </p>
<p><strong>Defiant.</strong> You refuse death. Your maximum Mortality points increase by 1.   </p>
<p><strong>Ether Bender.</strong> You must be level 8 or higher to take this skill. You can manipulate and wield the latent energies of spirits as both a weapon and a tool. You weave the vibrant, polychromatic threads of Ether as both a tool and weapon. You can spend 2 Actions and 2 Stamina to perform any of the following Etheric feats.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Feel:</u> You cast the Amalgamate spell.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Ride:</u> You cast the Teleport spell. The negative effects of this spell are circumvented, and you are not required to roll 1d4 as you normally would when casting Teleport. The targets of this spell automatically 138 teleport to the exact desired location with no other effects.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Shape:</u> You cure the Broken condition on an item of your choice, or the Corrupted condition on a creature of your choice.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Twist:</u> You send ripples through the threads of fate. You choose to grant either advantage or disadvantage to the next ability check or attack roll made by a creature of your choice who you can see.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Warp:</u> You attempt to warp the mind of an enemy of your choice who you can see. The target must succeed a Will check against a DC of 10 or become Corrupted.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Flay:</u> You lash out with the threads, weaving them out of thin air to pierce an enemy of your choice. Make an attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 damage.   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fate-Marked.</strong> A small polychromatic mark depicting an ornate key with a triangular ring appears somewhere on your body. The mark seems to move and shift in place, as if it were a flowing liquid trapped just beneath your skin. Once per Rest, you can reroll any single 1d20 roll you make. In addition, you can press your mark against a fate-marked door to open it. Fate-marked doors cannot be opened by those who do not bear the mark.   </p>
<p><strong>Gunslinger.</strong> You add your Agility score modifier as a bonus to attack rolls you make using firearms. You also gain the ability to perform the following maneuvers.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Unjam:</u> You spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to fix your Broken firearm in the heat of battle. Whenever you use this trick, your currently wielded firearm is becomes reloaded and is cured of the Broken condition.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Fan the Hammer:</u> You spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to rapidly fire a firearm’s entire ammunition capacity. You make an amount of attack rolls with your firearm equal to the amount of ammunition it is currently loaded with. Each attack roll made with this trick is rolled at disadvantage due to the chaotic nature of the maneuver. You can only perform this trick if you have one hand unoccupied.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Finger Dance:</u> You spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to both reload your firearm and make an attack roll with it.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Quick Draw:</u> Your quick reflexes allow you to fire a shot whenever a combat encounter begins with you as a participant. Before initiative is rolled, you can spend 2 Stamina to draw a firearm and make an attack roll with it as a Reaction.   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grudge.</strong> Someone has done you wrong, and nothing can stand between you and retribution. When you take this skill, choose a creature to act as the target of your Grudge. You make attack rolls with advantage against the target of your grudge. If the target of you grudge dies, you lose this skill. You can then choose a new skill of your choice to replace it during your next Rest.   </p>
<p><strong>Haunted.</strong> A traumatic event in your past has granted you with an edge in dangerous situations at the cost of your own sanity. You make all Agility checks and Will checks with advantage, and become permanently Corrupted.   </p>
<p><strong>Hireling.</strong> You spend 30 Coin to take this skill and gain a hireling as a companion. This hireling follows you and your commands for 1 month or until they die. Once your hireling leaves you or dies, you lose this skill and gain a new skill of your choice.   </p>
<p><strong>Knack.</strong> A sliver of Ether has found its way into your form, awakening a sliver of magic within you. You gain 2 spells of your choice. These spells must be ones which cost 2 Mana or less. If you are not a caster, you 139 can cast each of these spells once per Rest.   </p>
<p><strong>Mariner.</strong> You roll with advantage on all ability checks to tie knots, navigate oceanic environments, or to control a waterborne vessel.   </p>
<p><strong>Mobile.</strong> You permanently gain 10 feet of Speed.   </p>
<p><strong>Noble.</strong> You are of a high caste, or born into a rich family or sect.
