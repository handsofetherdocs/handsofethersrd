They use their knowledge and wisdom to aid their allies in overcoming obstacles that cannot be solved through steel and courage alone.</p>

<p><strong>Cost: 1 Action</strong><br />
Your extensive studies have sharpened your mind into a tool of supernatural examination and deduction. You can take a moment to assess a subject to reveal hidden secrets and clues. You can use this ability an unlimited amount of times per Rest, but you cannot use it on a specific subject more than once per Rest.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Item:</u> You learn your choice of an item’s purpose, properties, or how to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Environment:</u> You learn a single fact of your choice your surroundings within 100 feet. This includes any nearby structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Creature:</u> You learn your choice of either a creature’s current Health, their primary ability, or their weakness if they have one. Alternatively, you can ask a single yes-or-no question about the creature and gain a truthful yes-or-no answer from the Guide in response.  </p>

<p><strong>Ancient Technique.</strong> You have been trained in a secret technique which enhances your ability to perform a certain kind of adventuring activity. Choose either melee attack rolls, ranged attack rolls, or a single type of ability check. Your choice is permanent. Whenever you attempt to use this chosen type of attack roll or ability check, you add your Wit score modifier as a bonus to that type of attack roll or ability check.   </p>
<p><strong>Antiquarian.</strong> Once per Rest, you can spend 10 minutes of time to meditate on an item in order to gleam mystical and vague visions of its history, past, purpose, and former owners. You also gain the spells Psychometry and Divulge. You can cast each of these spells once per Rest.   </p>
<p><strong>Arcane Augmentation.</strong> You have performed a number of arcane augmentations on yourself to enhance your physical and magical capabilities. Choose one of the following effects to benefit from each Rest. Each chosen effect lasts until your next Rest.   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Shadow Sight:</u> You are able to perfectly see in areas obscured by darkness as if those areas were not obscured.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Spectral Sight:</u> You are able to see Invisible creatures as if they were not Invisible, and you automatically see through disguises and illusions.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Steel Stomach:</u> You make Might checks with advantage to resist toxins, poisons, and diseases.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Radiance:</u> A part of your body can glow with a bright light. You can cast this light or extinguish this light as a Free Action. The light illuminates the area around you within a 50 foot radius.   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arcanist.</strong> You become proficient in artifacts, and you roll with advantage on Wit checks to recall or understand information about magic, including esoteric forces, guilds, sciences, history, and artifacts.   </p>
<p><strong>Arcanomechanical Suit.</strong> Over the course of the past few months, you have been fabricating a special suit of armor infused with arcane implements. This suit, which is now complete, has a number of functions. Your suit grants you a Defense bonus of +3 while it is worn, even if you are lack armor proficiency. A small dial on the suit's belt can be tuned to emanate a magically generated shield which protects you from certain types of damage. Each Rest, choose either acid, fire, electricity, or ice and water to act as your resistance until your next Rest. If a spell or attack damages you using this chosen source, you reduce the amount of damage you take from that attack by 1d4. Lastly, your suit also has a number of alchemical concoctions stored within it which can cause spell-like reactions - all of which are consistently sporadic and chaotic. Once per round, you can activate the sigils on your suit to cause a concoction to activate. If you do so, roll 1d6 on the following table to determine the result.</p>

<p><strong>Bookworm.</strong> While in a place of study, you are automatically able to find the answers you seek when attempting to scour the ancient knowledge stored within. In addition, being in a place of learning puts you at ease and rejuvenates you. Upon spending an hour of time in a place of learning, you regain the same benefits as you would from taking a Rest. Lastly, you gain the spell Tome Tap, which you can cast once per Rest.   </p>
<p><strong>Counsel.</strong> Once per round, you can lend enlightening advice to an ally as a Free Action. An ally of your choice who can hear you adds a bonus equal to 1 + your Wit score modifier to their next ability check or attack roll.   </p>
<p><strong>Coroner.</strong> You can examine a creature's corpse to determine their exact cause and time of death.   </p>
<p><strong>Crooked Tongue.</strong> You roll with advantage on all Will checks made to deceive or lie to other creatures.   </p>
<p><strong>Cryptographer.</strong> You roll with advantage on Wit checks made to understand a written or spoken code. In addition, you can create your own written code that cannot be understood except by yourself and up to five other creatures of your choice.   </p>
<p><strong>Decipher.</strong> You are especially good at discerning context clues when attempting to understand a language that is unknown to you. You can instead understand the general meaning of words which are spoken or written in a language you do not know.   </p>
<p><strong>Dismantle.</strong> Your understanding of contraptions and their inner workings has become almost intuitive. You can spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to cause a nonmagical trap, machine, or automaton to become Broken and disabled.   </p>
<p><strong>Forged Bond.</strong> You have become especially proficient in using your own creations. You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with any weapon you have created yourself.   </p>
<p><strong>Good Company.</strong> You roll with advantage on all Aid checks you make, and you can Aid an ally even if they are attempting a solitary endeavor which they could not otherwise receive Aid from.   </p>
<p><strong>Grenadier.</strong> You have become especially proficient in lobbing thrown projectiles at foes. You can throw potions and bombs at a target that is a number of feet away equal to twice the projectile's default range without making that attack roll with disadvantage.   </p>
