<h1 id="items">Items<a class="headerlink" href="#items" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Adventurers rely heavily on their gear and equipment to carry them through challenging endeavors. Some Adventurers rely on these items more than others, such as a Warrior’s weaponry. Others are able to create and fabricate items to aid themselves and their companions. Adventurers must have a proficiency in a type of weaponry or form of protection in order to be able to use them. A proficiency in magic is not required to use items that are enchanted. Enchanted weapons, shields, and armor can be used by any Adventurer as long as they are proficient in that form of weaponry or protection.  </p>
<p>Most items cost 1 Action to use. The exceptions to this rule is armor, which is automatically and passively used if it is being worn, and ranged weaponry, which requires 1 Action to reload before being used to attack again.</p>

<strong>Shield</strong><br />
<em>Use:</em> 1 Action<br />
<em>Defense Bonus:</em> +2<br />
<em>Bulk:</em> 1  </p>
<p>Target, crested, buckler, tower; shields come in many shapes, sizes, and design. Adventurers can raise their shield for 1 Action to add that shield’s Defense bonus to their total current Defense.</p>
<p><strong>Armor</strong><br />
<em>Use:</em> Passive<br />
<em>Defense Bonus:</em> +2<br />
<em>Bulk:</em> 2  </p>
<p>Whether they prefer leather, plate, or chainmail, all Adventurers can find security while wearing a protective suit of armor. Wearing armor increases an Adventurer’s Defense by 2.</p>
<p><strong>Light Melee Weapon</strong><br />
<em>Use:</em> 1 Action<br />
<em>Damage:</em> 1d6<br />
<em>Range:</em> 5 feet<br />
<em>Bulk:</em> 1  </p>

<em>Damage:</em> 1d8<br />
<em>Range:</em> 5 feet<br />

<em>Bulk:</em> 1  </p>
<p>Bows, crossbows, or slingshots are some examples of ranged weapons. Sometimes it's best not to get too close to your enemies. ranged weapons are a safer alternative, but are slower to use than other weapons due to their need to be reloaded with an Action after each attack.  </p>
<p><strong>Reach Weapon</strong><br />
<em>Use:</em> 1 Action<br />
<em>Damage:</em> 1d6<br />
<em>Range:</em> 10 feet <br />
<em>Bulk:</em> 2</p>
<p>Spears, halberds, warhammers, tridents, and other long-handled weaponry have an extended reach and are favored by those that live a martial lifestyle. They are considered reach weapons in terms of proficiency and crafting.   </p>
<p><strong>Improvised Weapon</strong><br />
<em>Use:</em> 1 Action   <br />
<em>Damage:</em> 1d4   <br />
<em>Range:</em> 5 feet<br />

<h2 id="firearms">Firearms<a class="headerlink" href="#firearms" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>These rare ranged weapons are a technological marvel which use a combination of gunpowder, intricate metalwork, and alchemical combustion to launch shells and balls of iron at a target to devastating effects. Like all ranged weapons, firearms take 1 Action to reload. Some firearms, however, hold more ammunition at a time than typical ranged weapons. Firearms with larger ammunition capacities still take 1 Action to reload, but do not have to be reloaded until they have been completely depleted of ammunition.</p>
<p>Due to these weapons not being completely perfected, they are often prone to malfunctions. Each firearm has a unique property called a “misfire rate”. Whenever a wielder of a firearm rolls a natural roll result of a firearm’s misfire or lower on their attack roll, the firearm becomes Broken. If an Adventurer does not possess a skill to fix a Broken firearm, they may need to seek out a powerful artificer within the world to fix their broken weapon in exchange for Coin.<br />

<h2 id="weapon-properties">Weapon Properties<a class="headerlink" href="#weapon-properties" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Some pieces of combat gear have special properties associated with them which alter their functionality.
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
<div style="grid-column: 1/2; margin-right: 13px;">
<strong>Cursed</strong><br />
Weaponry that has been infected by an evil force. On a hit, cursed weapons deal an additional amount of damage equal to the wielder’s Will score modifier. If an Adventurer rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a cursed weapon, they become Corrupted.   </p>
<p><strong>Gruesome</strong><br />
Gruesome weapons are especially brutal or nefarious in their design, such as a heavy obsidian hammer or a barbed broadsword. A creature hit with a gruesome weapon must succeed a Might check against a DC of 5 or become Wounded.   </p>

<p><strong>Keen</strong><br />
On a hit, keen weapons cause a creature to become Bleeding.   </p>
<p><strong>Mythic</strong><br />
A weapon with a legendary history. Although lesser in magnitude and power than a fable relic or a hand of Ether, a mythic weapon still has the power of stories and determination behind it. These two forces empower the mythic weapon far beyond the reaches of a typical piece of steel or shining shield. The Guide creates the abilities of a mythic weapon, and then keeps those abilities a secret until that weapon has been exalted. Until it is exalted, the item acts as a default weapon. To become exalted, the wielder of the mythic weapon must perform two tasks of the Guide’s choice, such as Learn and speak the weapon’s true name. Perform a heroic act with the weapon. Meditate on the weapon alone, for 1 week. Afterwards, the mythic weapon’s potential is unlocked, gaining magical abilities.  </p>
<p></div>
<div style="grid-column: 2/3; margin-right: 13px;"></p>
<p><strong>Poisoned</strong><br />
The first time a creature is hit with a poisoned weapon, the target must succeed a Might check against a DC of 10 or become Sapped. The target remains Sapped until it is cured by a spell or skill. After a poisoned weapon is used to make a successful attack roll, the weapon is no longer considered poisoned.   </p>
<p><strong>Swift</strong><br />
Swift weapons can be used to make an attack roll as a Reaction whenever initiative is rolled, as long as the wielder already has the swift weapon drawn. This effect cannot be used if the wielder is not within the swift weapon’s range of a target at the beginning of combat.   </p>

Silver weaponry ignores a creature's resistance to nonmagical damage.  </p>

<p>Potions are consumable concoctions that can be used by Adventurers to alter their condition through the power of alchemy. Potions weigh 0 Bulk, cost 5 Coin each, and cost 1 Action to use. Once a potion is used, it is spent and cannot be used again. The vial that held the potion, however, remains in the Adventurer’s possession. For the purposes of proficiency, all potions are considered ranged weapons if they are tossed at an enemy as an attack roll.  </p>
<h3 id="brewing-potions-advanced-rule">Brewing Potions; Advanced Rule<a class="headerlink" href="#brewing-potions-advanced-rule" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Much like creating custom spells, the potions listed in the ‘Potions’ section are merely a framework of what a potion has the potential to do. At the Guide’s discretion, Adventurers can brew new potions with custom effects. Potions can have any effect that the brewer wishes.  </p>
<p>The Adventurer determines the potion’s effect and how it functions, and the Guide modifies and balances it accordingly. To brew a potion in this way, the Adventurer will have to collect the necessary ingredients, determined by the Guide. The recipe could call for any combination of up to three ingredients that are required to brew the concoction.  </p>
<p>The Adventurer must then journey to and collect these designated ingredients in-game. After crafting the custom potion, the Adventurer must make a Wit check against a DC of 5 to brew the tincture. On a failure, a Mechanical Mishap occurs and the potion as intended becomes useless.<br />

A complex brass-lined lens which a creature can peer through to observe their surroundings within a 3 mile radius.   </p>
<p><strong>Instrument</strong><br />
Harps, lutes, drums, and other such musical instruments are rare and valuable, but can go a long way for the morale of an adventuring party. If played during a Rest, each character who can hear the instrument gains 2 Sanity points from their Rest instead of the default of 1.   </p>
<p><strong>Glider</strong><br />
A gnome-made harness that has a set of leathery wings within it. The glider can be used to glide through the air.

<h2 id="custom-magical-items">Custom Magical Items<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-magical-items" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The Guide is free to create their own magical items and artifacts to reward their Adventurers with. There are no particular rules for creating magical items, but caution is suggested when creating such an item and granting the Adventurer’s access to it. Magic items can sometimes be so overwhelming in their power that the challenges within the game begin to become joyless. Common sense and forethought is the Guide’s most valuable asset when thinking up new magical items.  </p>
<p>The simplest and most mechanically balanced way to create a magical item is to think of a nonmagical item and combine that item with a certain skill or spell as its effect. Skills and spells by themselves are not overtly powerful, and gaining a new skill through the possession of an arcane item can be a great reward for an Adventurer.  </p>
<p>A magic dagger used by a Warrior, for instance, could be infused with the Witch skill ‘Crimson Rite’, allowing the Warrior to receive visions about the enemies they slay using the dagger.  </p>
<h2 id="relics">Relics<a class="headerlink" href="#relics" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Forgotten artifacts of the ancient heroes, the Relics are the most valuable reward an Adventurer could hope to obtain. Relics are magical items which cannot become Broken and can never be unenchanted or otherwise manipulated by any known force or entity, save for the greatest of deities. They are treasures of immeasurable power and potential.  </p>
<p>Each of the Relic’s exact effects should be determined by the Guide using their best judgment and interpretation of the Relic’s descriptions. Adventurers who are level 8 or lower must make a Will check against a DC of 5 whenever they touch a Relic for the first time. On a success, that Adventurer gains the Relic. On a failure, the Relic rejects the Adventurer. The Adventurer dies forever, cannot be resurrected. They become lost and ever adrift amidst the Ether.<br />
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
<div style="grid-column: 1/2; margin-right: 13px;">

A tall ivory warhammer with a thin shaft and an ornate hammerhead. The wielder of Agonmaul adds their level as a bonus to all attack rolls they make with it. The Agonmaul can strike any nonmagical item, item, or structure and cause that target to become Broken. The Agonmaul can be wielded as if it were a heavy melee weapon, a light melee weapon, or a ranged weapon. Whenever the Agonmaul is used as a ranged weapon, it automatically returns to its owner’s hand after it is thrown. The Agonmaul can only be lifted by its current owner. The Agonmaul cannot be moved by darkness.   </p>
<p><strong>Autumn Arbiter</strong><br />
A crossbow made up of woven golden threads, onyx, and dark wood. The stock of the crossbow is emblazoned with a golden sigil in the shape of a maple leaf. All attack rolls made with the Arbiter gain a bonus of its wielder’s level. The Arbiter is a device of immense divine power. The Arbiter causes ripples in the ether whenever its bolts move through the air.   </p>
<p><strong>Chalice of Aurum</strong><br />
A golden chalice filled with vibrant swirls of Ether, prismatic in coloration. The face of the Chalice depicts both Elpo, the mother goddess, as well as her children, the Seven Sublime, in exquisitely detailed etchings. Those that drink from the Chalice must succeed a Will check against a DC of 18. On a failure, both the drinker and the Chalice are teleported to differing locations of the Guide’s choice. The drinker then becomes permanently Corrupted as a result of their soul and body being unfit to withstand the Chalice’s power. On a success, the drinker becomes a minor god.   </p>
<p><strong>Dawn Disc</strong><br />
The Disc is a golden maul which can blossom outwards into a perfectly circular and completely invincible shield. The Disc can be wielded as either a heavy melee weapon or a shield. It can change forms between these two options as a Free Action. While in its shield form, the Disc’s Defense bonus is equal to 5. The Disc can cast the Beam spell once per Rest. The Disc sheds the sun’s holy light no matter how dark its surroundings truly are. Its light is infectious, and encroaches into every emptiness around it, even those unknown to mortal kind.   </p>
<p><strong>Gravezeal</strong><br />
A massive, looming scythe of black wood and dead metal. Gravezeal is considered a reach weapon, and has a melee attack range of 15 feet. On a hit, the target must roll 1d6. On a roll of 1, the target dies forever and becomes a corpse companion to the wielder of Gravezeal. Gravezeal can cut through life itself, and can shape already living things into undead shadows of their former selves.   </p>
<p><strong>Luna Wand</strong><br />
The Luna Wand is sometimes called the Bastard Wand. The Luna Wand is a shard of sheared titan bone with black roots twisted around it. The Luna Wand increases its wielder’s spell DC by 5, to a maximum of 20. Once per Rest, the Luna Wand can cast any spell of its wielder’s choice once per Rest. The wand is cursed. Whenever the wand is used to cast a spell, the wielder must make a Will check against a DC of 5. On a failure, the wielder becomes Corrupted. The Luna Wand has the soul of the Frost Witch trapped within it, and it will take advantage of any opportunity to betray insufferable mortals who dare grasp its knotted shaft.   </p>
<p></div>
<div style="grid-column: 2/3; margin-right: 13px;">
<strong>Maelgwyn</strong><br />

If the wearer of Maelgwyn takes damage, they regain 1d6 Health as a Reaction. If the wearer of Maelgwyn becomes Wounded, the Wounded condition ends for them during their next Rest. A creature wearing Maelgwyn can cast the spell Brambles once per Rest. Maelgwyn is the heart of all plantlife. Maelgwyn thinks and feels, and has the impulse to become unified with its wearer. Maelgwyn prefers to travel. Most importantly, Maelgwyn is most powerful when it has room to grow, such as when it is far away from other forms of plant life.   </p>
<p><strong>Mirthmythron</strong><br />
Mirthmythron harbors a fragment of Ether stolen from each and every artist and performer who has ever lived or ever will live. Mirthmythron is a silver lute with thirteen strings made of golden threading. Instead of a lute, the Relic can sometimes manifest as a harp made of the same materials. The wielder of Mirthmythron gains 3d10 inspire die, and can grant them in accordance within the rules of the Inspire ability, even if the wielder is not a Bard. Mirthmythron breathes deeply at night, and its melodies are purest under the moonlight.   </p>
<p><strong>Netherfeng</strong><br />
A dark, wavy dagger sharp enough to cut a shadow from the ground. Netherfeng has three tendrils of ghostly grey fabric which drip from its handle. The threads move through the air like smoke. The wielder of Netherfeng gains a bonus equal to their Agility score modifier to all attack rolls they make with the Relic. Netherfeng can be used as a light melee weapon or a ranged weapon. Whenever Netherfeng is used as a ranged weapon, the wielder can choose to either teleport to wherever the Relic lands as a Reaction or to have the Relic teleport back into their grasp as a Free Action. The wielder can also choose to create thick gray clouds of fog around themselves and the dagger in a 10 foot radius area whenever they hit an enemy with the Relic. Netherfeng has an eye in its hilt, but it will only open it when there is something worth looking at. Netherfeng has trickery forged into its blade.   </p>
<p><strong>Nidhogg</strong><br />
A pastel colored rapier with a prismatic hilt. The blade does not have, and has no need for, a guard. Nidhogg is considered a reach weapon. The wielder of Nidhogg adds their level as a bonus to all attack rolls they make with this Relic. On a hit, the target becomes pierced by light of every color, and feels deep remorse for any evil deeds they have committed. Nidhogg can bend and move around corners, and is especially deadly when wielded by a creature who has lost everything.   </p>
<p><strong>Old Wrath</strong><br />
Wrath is an ivory revolver made of ancient wood from the darkest forest. Wrath is a revolver with a misfire rate of 1 and an ammunition capacity of 4. Wrath does not become Broken from a misfire. Instead, if the wielder of Wrath misfires while using it, they become Corrupted. On a critical hit made with Wrath, the target becomes Wounded.   </p>
<p><strong>The Sword</strong><br />
Only a true hero can touch The Sword’s hilt. The blade is not as discriminating. The Sword has a +5 bonus to all attack rolls made with it, and is considered a magical light melee weapon. On a hit, the target automatically becomes affected by the Etheric Ray spell. Once per Rest, the wielder can spend 1 Action to cast 1 Cleric or Witch spell of their choice by holding the Sword towards the heavens. Legends say that the Sword is sharp enough to cut a shadow from the ground.  </p>

<h2 id="hands-of-ether">Hands of Ether<a class="headerlink" href="#hands-of-ether" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The Hands of Ether are the most pure of the Relics. Some dedicate their lives to obtain a Hand, making great sacrifices to wield their power. Some Hands find their way to worthy heroes in times of great need. The first Hands were given to the mortals by Elpo, the mother goddess, to ensure her creation’s protection from her treacherous brother’s malicious war on creation. Other Hands, given by lesser gods or created by enterprising mortals of great power, soon found their ways into the hearts of ancient forest tombs and forgotten halls in the bowels of other realms. To gain a Hand, an Adventurer must cut off their own hand.  </p>
<p>These are the Hands of Ether, wielded only by those at
the pinnacle of fate.

<div style="grid-column: 1/2; margin-right: 13px;">

<div style="grid-column: 2/3; margin-right: 13px;"></p>
<p><strong>Pale Hand</strong><br />
Banished to the deepest trenches of the Ether during the Pale War, the hand of the unborn god of anticreation and nullification is a malevolent instrument of undoing and chaotic corruption. Its gaunt ivory form causes horror to all who see it. When first attached to a new wielder, that wielder must succeed a Will check against a DC of 10 or have their soul lost forever. The wielder’s soul is lost, and that Adventurer becomes consumed by the Hand’s corruption. The lost Adventurer falls under the Guide’s control. If the wielder succeeds their Will check, they gain the Pale Hand. The wielder can spend 1 Action and 2 Stamina to cause a creature within 500 feet to become Corrupted. The wielder gains the Hex ability, regardless of their class. The wielder gains the spells Black Crown, Vex, Pale Blade, Wither, and Bane. The wielder can cast each of these spells once per Rest for no Mana cost. The wielder of this hand can always spend Stamina as if it were Mana, or spend Mana as if it were Stamina. Lastly, once per Rest, the wielder of the Pale Hand can point at a creature within 100 feet of it in an attempt to sever that creature’s Etheric thread. The target must make a Will check against a DC of 10 or die instantly. If the target dies as a result of this effect, they cannot be resurrected, and their soul is shattered and lost.  </p>
